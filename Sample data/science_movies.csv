1997;It 's obviously a major malfunction . ... their President is a crook . Well , I 'm not a crook . Robert Kennedy was shot in that ballroom . Thank God Almighty , we are free at last ! A sniper has fired at President Kennedy . Or have you ever been a member of the Communist party ? Hi-yo , Silver ! ... 1941 ... ... a date which will live in infamy . We bring you the final edition of our Maxwell House Good News of 1939 . Good evening , Mr. and Mrs. North America , and all the ships at sea . The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . CQ ... ... this is W-9 GFO . CQ , this is W-9 GFO here . Come back ? CQ ... ... this is W-9 GFO here . Come back ? CQ , this is W-9 GFO . Is anybody out there ? Not getting anything . Small moves , Ellie . Small moves . CQ , this is W-9 GFO here . Come back ? Copy , W-9 GFO . K-4 WLD here . What do I say ? Just be yourself . Where are you , K-4 WLD ? Come back ? Pensacola . Over . Pensacola , where 's Pensacola ? I 'll give you a hint . Orange juice . Copy that , K-4 WLD . How 's the weather down there in Florida ? Pensacola , Florida . I have to tell you , Sparks . Pretty good . That 's the farthest yet . Can we hear all the way to New York ? Sure . Can we hear all the way to California ? I do n't see why not . Can we hear all the way to Alaska ? On a really clear day . Can we hear all the way to China ? On a really , really clear day . Could we talk to the moon ? If it 's a big enough radio , I do n't see why not . Could we talk to Jupiter ? Or what 's the one after that ? Do n't tell me . I 'll give you a hint . Hula-Hoops . Saturn ! Could we talk to Saturn ? Dad , could we talk to Mom ? I do n't think even the biggest radio could reach that far . All right , no more stalling . Pensacola ! That 's a beauty . Now get some sleep . Hey , Dad ? Do you think there's people on other planets ? I do n't know , Sparks . But I guess I 'd say ... ... if it is just us ... ... it seems like an awful waste of space . CQ , this is W-9 GFO . Repeat . This is W-9 GFO . Come back ? I 'm going to need a bigger antenna . What do you think , Doc Arroway ? Is n't she a beauty ? It 'll do . The village is five miles away . There 's a general store in the cantina . They can order anything from San Juan . When can I get dish time ? Dr. Clark said you couldn't wait . Your first shift is tonight . Go back . Try back a little bit . You had something there . There ! - Right there ? - You hear it ? Right there , that 's it . All right , 1221.46 . That's well within the L-band . Check off-axis . On it . It 's not in the neighborhood . Here it is . J-1741 ... ... + 2748 . Catalogued November Must 've been the glitch in the timing 's what threw me . Must 've been a starquake . I think it 's great that you listen . Most don't do that anymore . It 's just an old habit . It makes it feel more real . Ellie . Kent Clark . They said you 'd been ... ... up at Owen 's Valley working under Drumlin . How 'd you like him ? That much ? About what I 'd expect after what he had to say about you . And what was that ? That you are brilliant ... ... driven ... ... a major pain in the ass ... ... and obsessed with a field of study he considers tantamount ... ... to professional suicide . Anything else ? Those were the highlights . Davio , Dr. Vernon . Dr. Arroway . Believe you 've already met our tireless research assistant , Mr. Fisher ... ... as well as his cologne . Brook 's looking at the black hole in M-87 . Eli 's studying Markarian Dr. Arroway will be spending her precious telescope time listening for ... ... listening for ... Little green men . One down ... ... a couple billion to go . Arecibo , right ? Does it show ? Cracker Jack ? No , thanks . Mind if I sit down ? I hear the locals , they call it `` El Radar. `` Convinced it has some dark military purpose . I think we 're harmless . Palmer Joss . - Ellie Arroway . - Nice to meet you , Ellie . What are you studying up there ? The usual . Nebulae , quasars , pulsars , stuff like that . What are you writing ? The usual . Nouns , adverbs ... ... adjective here and there . I work on a project , SETI . Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ? That is out there ! Are you a student or something ? I 'm a writer . I'm writing a book . I 'm here doing research about how technology affects Third World cultures . I 'm also looking for this guy , David Drumlin . He 's head of the National Science Foundation . I want an interview . I take it you know him ? You could say that . SETI . That 's fringe ! I 've crossed paths with him . Something like that must really chap his ass . Compass . That 's for you . You better keep this . Might save your life someday . Have dinner with me tonight ? I do n't make a good research subject . I 'm not quotable . No quotes . Scout 's honor . Good meal , good company . I 've got to go . Drumlin 's coming in Tuesday . Now I remember why I took that desk job . Dr. Drumlin , how are you ? Glad you could make it . If I 'd known it took 3 planes , I might 've reconsidered . How is that new office ? Still settling in . They already want to give half my budget to the Pentagon . Still waiting for E.T . to call ? Good to see you too ! Asshole ! Looks like it 's going to be a long night . Science must be accountable to the people paying for it , the taxpayers . We must stop wasting money on pie-in-the-sky abstractions ... ... and spend it on practical , measurable ways ... ... to improve the lives of the people who are paying . Not unlike my L-band , globular clusters work . You want to do away with all pure research now ? What 's wrong with science being practical ? Even profitable ? Nothing , as long as your motive ... ... is the search for truth . Which is what the pursuit of science is . That 's an interesting position from a man ... ... on a crusade against the evils of technology ... ... Father Joss . I 'm not against technology , Doctor . I 'm against ... ... the men who deify it at the expense of human truth . Kent , I need to have a word with you . Over here , please . You think that hurt my chances with that interview ? You 're a priest ? Not really . I got my Masters in Divinity ... ... then left the seminary to do secular humanitarian work ... ... coordinating Third World churches . I could n't live with the celibacy thing . You could call me a man of the cloth ... ... without the cloth . You want to get out of here ? You see that large W-shaped constellation there ? That 's Cassiopeia . And Cassiopeia A gives off a whole lot of radio signals . I listen to them a lot . It 's a remnant of a supernova . When did you know you wanted to be an astronomer ? When I was about eight years old ... ... watching the sunset , I asked Dad , '' What 's that bright star over there ? '' He said that it wasn't a star . It was ... ... a whole planet called Venus ... ... which should be over there soon . He said , `` You know why they called it Venus ? Because they thought it was so beautiful and glowing . But they did n't know ... ... that it 's filled with ... ... deadly gases and sulfuric acid rain. `` Wow , I thought , `` This is it ! I 'm hooked ! '' There are four hundred billion stars out there ... ... just in our galaxy alone . If only one out of a million of those had planets ... ... if just one out of a million of those had life ... ... and if just one out of a million of those had intelligent life ... ... there would be literally millions of civilizations out there ... If there was n't ... ... it 'd be an awful waste of space . Amen . So I was lying there , just looking at the sky . And then I felt something . I do n't know . All I know is that I was n't alone . For the first time in my life I was n't scared of nothing ... ... not even dying . It was God . And there 's no chance that ... ... you had this experience because some part of you needed to have it ? I 'm a reasonably intelligent guy , but this ... My intellect couldn't even touch this . No . I 've been to Sunday school a few times . And ? I kept asking all these really annoying questions like ... ... '' Where did Mrs. Cain come from ? '' And pretty soon they asked my dad ... ... if he would n't mind keeping me home from now on . Your dad ... Is it this guy ? Yeah . You 're close to him , are n't you ? I was . He died when I was nine years old . I never got to know my mother . I 'm sorry . That 's got to be tough . Being alone . What do you say ... ... we pack a picnic tomorrow and hike up to Mount Arecibo ? I do n't think I can . I 've got to work . How about dinner tomorrow night ? I know a great dive . No , I do n't think so . Ellie , did I miss something ? No . Shit , I 'm late ! I told Kent that I'd be there at 10:30 . I 'm not trying to push you . I 've wanted to look at this sector for weeks . Just hang out ... ... and sleep in . There's food in the fridge . How can I reach you ? Just leave your number . I 'll call you . Dad ! It 's starting , you're going to miss it ! Dad , there 's another one ! Hurry up ! In a minute , Sparks ! I 'm almost done . There 's another one . Come on , hurry up , Dad ! I 'll get the medicine . I know it 's hard to understand this now ... ... but we aren't always meant to know why things happen the way they do . Sometimes , we just have to accept it ... ... as God 's will . I should have kept medicine in the downstairs bathroom . Then I could've gotten to it sooner . CQ ... ... this is W-9 GFO . Do you copy ? Dad , this is Ellie . Come back . This is Eleanor Arroway ... ... transmitting on 14.2 megahertz . Are you there ? Come back . Are you there ? Dad , this is Ellie . Hi , Kent . What are you doing up so early ? I was thinking ... ... we 'd make a pretty good team . We could put together an ad hoc SETI program . You know the Very Large Array in New Mexico ? It 's a dynamite place to do SETI work ... What are you talking about ? Drumlin pulled the plug . We 're homeless . It 's true , you pulled the plug ? You ca n't see it now , but I 'm doing you a favor . You 're too promising a scientist to waste your gifts on this nonsense . I do n't consider what could be ... ... the most important human discovery nonsense ! And two probabilities . One , there 's intelligent life ... ... but too far away to contact in your lifetime . - And two ! - You 're making a decision ... There 's nothing but gases and carbon compounds and you're wasting your time ! In the meantime , you wo n't be taken seriously . Your career will be over ! So what ? It 's my life ! Hey , Kent . You were right . Screw Drumlin . We 'll raise the money ourselves . We'll go to New Mexico . Chicago 's set . Let me know how it goes . I 've got more corporate stops on the East Coast for you . Did that investor from Houston ever get back to us ? I 'll hit him up on my way to L.A. Beg for some of that Hollywood money ! They 've been making money off aliens for years . - Begging is good for the soul . - We 'll see . Just do me a favor . Try not to be too ... confrontational . Confrontational ? Me ? What do you mean ? I 'll see if I left anything . It 's a unique time in our history , in the history of any civilization . It 's the moment of the acquisition of technology . That 's the moment where contact becomes possible . The Very Large Array in New Mexico ... ... is the key to our chances for success . With its 27 linked radio telescopes ... ... we can search more accurately than at any other facility . We 've gotten approval to buy the telescope time from the government . Now all we really need is the money . A nice presentation , Doctor . But while our foundation arm has a mandate to support ... ... experimental programs , your proposal ... ... seems less like science , and more like science fiction . Science fiction . You 're right . It 's crazy . In fact , it 's even worse than that : nuts ! Want to hear something nutty ? Two guys wanted to build a thing called an airplane . People go in it and fly like birds . Ridiculous , right ? What about breaking the sound barrier ... ... or rockets to the moon , or atomic energy or a mission to Mars ? Science fiction , right ? All I 'm asking is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision . To step back and look at the big picture . Take a chance on something which could end up the most impactful moment ... ... for humanity , for the history ... ... of history . I 'm sorry . I just spent 13 months ... ... coming into rooms and talking to people like you . You 're my last chance . Sorry I wasted your time . Doctor . Yes , sir . You have your money . Thank you . Thank you . Perfect cast ! Come on , fishy ! Frank , look at the size ... ... of that son-of-a-bitch ! Welcome back , Dr. C. How 'd it go ? How was the trip ? I 've had better . Drumlin ! Is this a personal vendetta now ? There 's been enormous pressure from other scientists as well . It does n't matter . Hadden's funding us for 2 more years . The government does n't want their telescopes used by the high priestess ... ... of the desert anymore . What ? Staring at TV static for hours , listening to washing machines . These stories get out ! I was seeking patterns in the chaos ! It does n't matter , we 're a joke to them . They want us out ! We 've got 3 months till the paperwork goes through . I 'll start looking for other funding . Could you face reality ? Just this once ? We lost . It 's over . Fine . I 'm not stopping . If I have to , I 'll go it alone . I 've done it before . My guest tonight is author and theologian Palmer Joss . He 's become a spiritual counselor , and a recent fixture at the White House . `` God 's Diplomat , '' according to The New York Times . His latest book , '' Losing Faith , '' is currently number one ... ... on that publication's bestseller list . Thanks for being here . You 've had quite a ride ... ... the last few years . Yeah , I sure have , Larry . Fish , I was thinking . Who would make the best astronomers ? Think about it . Who has the perfect synthesis of career and lifestyle ? I give . Vampires ! Are you anti-technology and anti-science ? No , not at all . The question that I 'm asking is this : Are we happier ... ... as a human race ? Is the world fundamentally a better place ... ... because of science and technology ? We shop at home , we surf the Web ... ... but at the same time we feel emptier ... ... and more cut off from each other than at any other time in human history . We 're becoming a synthesized society ... ... in a hurry to get to the ... We 're looking for the meaning . What is the meaning ? We have mindless jobs , take frantic vacations . Deficit finance trips to the mall to buy things ... ... that we think will fill these holes in our lives . Any wonder we 've lost our sense of direction ? Holy shit ! Right ascension ... ... 18 hours , 36 minutes , 56.2 seconds ! Declination ... ... + 36 degrees , 46 minutes ... ... 56.2 seconds ! Confirm ! Right ascension , 18 hours , 36 minutes ... ... 56.2 seconds ! Is anybody awake in there ? I 'm moving the array ! - Confirm ! Boss has a bogey ! Right ascension , 18 hours ... We 're on it ! ... 47 minutes and 1 second ! Strong possible ... ... pulse chain on sub-array four ! I 'm moving the rest . Confirm coordinates ! Check the status of the array . She 's doing all the dishes . Systems nominal . Hello . Full systems check ! Coordinates confirmed . Willie 's checking the system . Stay on top of the systems diagnostics ! Check reference point offsets . And I want you off-axis on And tell Willie to break out the big boy ! Copy that . Yeah ! Go , Ellie ! I hear it on the headphones . We got to be sure about this . Give me another array status . Her four are online , the rest are tracking in . But there 's a bad drive on 16 . The four are online , the rest are tracking in . There 's a bad drive on 16 . Copy that ? What shall I do about the source queue ? Forget it and hold the queue . Get ready to set the target frequency to manual the second we 're aligned . Do you copy ? I want you to go off-axis on 27 the second we 're there ! And leave the LO frequency where it is ! Do n't let it get away ! If you lose it , scan the band ! Run every frequency you can think of . How you doing ? Talk to me , guys . Partially polarized moving pulses , amplitude modulated . We 're locked . Systems are fine . What 's the frequency ? ... 23 gigahertz . Hydrogen times pi . Told you ! Strong sucker too ! I got it ! I 'm patched in ! Let me hear . Listen to that . Make me a liar , Fish . It could be AWACS out of Kirkland jamming us . But I doubt it . See if F.U.D.D . 's reading it too . Patch it back and give me the off-axis . - We recording ? - Never stopped . Thank you , Elmer ! AWACS status is negative . White Sands ? On this frequency ? No . I 'll punch up the darks . How 's spying tonight ? Come on ! NORAD 's not tracking any snoops in this vector . Shuttle 's in sleep mode . Okay , point source confirmed . Whatever it is , it ai n't local . Position ? I checked interferometry . Somewhere in Lyra . - Vega ? - Ca n't be ! It 's only 26 light years away . - Peak intensity ? - Coming up ! Vega . Vega . I scanned it a bunch of times at Arecibo . It was always negative . Got it ! Reading over 100 janskys . Jesus ! I can pick it up on my ... No ! Come on ! It 's restarting . Wait a minute . Those are numbers . That was 3 , before it was 2 . Base 10 numbers . Count and see how far we get . One . Seven . Those are primes . all prime numbers . No way that 's a natural phenomenon ! Let 's just calm down and pull up the star file on Vega . It does n't make any sense . The system is too young . It ca n't have a planetary system ... ... let alone life or a technological civilization . Maybe they 're not from there , they 're visiting . Spacecraft ? This system 's full of debris . It 'd get clobbered . Not if they used their laser blasters and photon torpedoes . - That 's not funny . - How else can we explain it ! He 's right . If we go public with this and we 're wrong ... ... it 's over . We 're cooked . I wish Kent was here . Whatever it is , let 's do something . Vega will set . Position confirmed . We 've got We 've got 112 janskys . Do you have a source location yet ? We put it right smack in the middle . Vega . Thanks . Keep tracking and we 'll get back to you . Right-o . ... through every prime number between 2 and 101. Who do we call now ? Everybody . The rumors are flying , the implications extraordinary . Detection of an unidentified ... ... radio source from space can neither be confirmed nor denied . But the military arriving ... Sources close to the VLA report they have been contacted ... ... by some form of intelligent being ... ... living outside our solar system . Again , there is no confirmation . I want all of these people out of here . Where 's the girl ? ... now confirm the signal . Vega 's now below our horizon . You 're hearing the signal from the Russian ... Get decryption people here . Lunacharsky's visiting at Cal Tech . Explain this to me . If the source of the signal is so sophisticated ... why the remedial math ? Why not just speak English ? Maybe because 70 % of the planet speaks other languages . Mathematics is the only truly universal language . It 's no coincidence that they 're using primes . I do n't get it . Prime numbers . Integers only divisible by themselves and 1 . We think this may be a beacon , an announcement ... ... to get our attention . If it 's attention you want , you got that . One thing : Vega . People have looked at Vega for years , with no results . Yesterday they start broadcasting primes . Why ? It 's hardly yesterday . The signal 's been transmitting for 26 years . Excuse me , who are you ? Michael Kitz , National Security Advisor . Your reputation ... First , ask the gentlemen with the guns to wait outside . This is a civilian facility . With all due respect ... Excuse me . Hi ! I 'm so glad you 're back ! Come hear this . Is this great ? - Who are all these people ? - I have no idea . Sit down . We need help with the spectrum analysis . - I 'll get on it . - Headsets . I 'll just come right to the point . Announcing this all over the world may well be a breach of national security . It 's not a person-to-person call . You think a civilization sending this message intends it just for Americans ? You might have consulted us . - The contents could be very sensitive . - You want to classify prime numbers ? Due to earth's rotation , we 're in line with Vega only hours a day . The only way to monitor the signal is to cooperate with other stations . If Dr. Arroway had n't acted quickly , we 'd have lost key elements . Fine , they 've got the primes . But if a more significant transmission is to come ... We need help to receive and decode . You understand that my job is to protect ... - Listen . - I hear it . Hear what ? Harmonic . Bingo ! I had Willie ask Rattan to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz . There 's a lot more here . - Get on the negative sideband . - I 'm already on it . What is it ? Another signal ! A second signal at double the frequency . Looks like ... Get a TV monitor ! Patch it into the image processor . Want the new data ? Yeah , the new one we just recorded . David , explain this to me , please . There 's another signal . Looks like a TV transmission . We 're hot . Go get the blinds . There is a lot of glare . You 're patched in . It 's definitely an image . Let 's try and stabilize it . What do you make of that ? It 's two different interlaced frames . I 'm framing one . - It 's just noise . - Trying frame two . I 've got an offset carrier . I think it 's audio . Plug it in ! Center that segment . Centering . Can you clean it up ? I 'm working on it . What the hell ... ? Try zooming out . Freeze ! Reverse values . Try zooming out again . Rotate 90 degrees counterclock ... My God ! What 's going on ? You 're not going to believe this . Does anybody speak German ? `` I declare the Games in Berlin ... ... at the celebration ... ... of the first Olympics of the New Era ... ... as opened. `` Get me the White House . defeating the bastard ... ... and he 's our first ambassador to outer space ? The broadcast of the '36 Olympics was the first TV transmission ... ... that went into space . Sending it back is a way of saying , `` Hello , we heard you. `` Or , `` Sieg Heil , you're our kind of people. `` Hitler 's politics have nothing to do with this . It 's unlikely they understood it . People must understand ... The people are in very good hands , Doctor . We 'll take it from here . Smile , folks . We 're on . A message of unknown origin from deep space ... ... was received by American scientists . Now to the White House . We 're told the President will have only a few remarks ... ... about today's extraordinary events ... ... and that he wo n't be taking any questions from the press . Good afternoon . I 'm glad to be joined by my ... ... Science and Technology Advisor . This is the product of years of exploration ... ... by some of the world's most distinguished scientists . Like all discoveries ... ... this one will continue to be reviewed ... ... examined ... ... and scrutinized . It must be confirmed by other scientists . But clearly ... ... the fact that this is being explored is a vindication ... Fish , what is the story over here ? I thought Ellie was supposed to be on . I do n't know . Guys ? Those interlaced frames we thought were noise ? This has structure . I 'm hearing structure . If this discovery is confirmed ... ... it will be one of the most stunning insights into our universe ... ... that science has ever uncovered . Its implications are as far-reaching ... ... and awe-inspiring as can be imagined . Even as it promises answers to some of our oldest questions ... ... it poses still others ... ... even more fundamental . We will continue to listen closely ... ... to what it has to say ... ... as we continue the search for answers ... ... and for knowledge ... ... that is as old as humanity itself ... ... but essential to our people 's future . Thank you . Is there a renewed assessment of security threat ? I 'll answer your questions after a few corrections . The message was received Friday ... ... at 6:31 a. m. Mountain Standard Time . It was largely mathematical ... ... and in spite of reports to the contrary ... ... appears to be completely benign in nature . Let me say that again . The message is completely benign . The President has contacted the world 's heads of state ... ... and every security measure is being taken . To better explain the events of the last 48 hours ... ... is the leader of the scientific team that made this remarkable discovery ... ... Dr. David Drumlin , special Science Advisor to the President . Thank you , Rachel . Hello . In 1936 a very faint television signal ... ... transmitted the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games as a show ... ... of German superior technology . That signal left Earth at the speed of light and ... arrived in the vicinity of the star we call Vega . That signal has been sent back to us hugely amplified ... ... an unmistakable sign of intelligence . Kent , go ahead . The Adolf transmission used 25 frames per second but we 're receiving 50 . So we put the other 25 through search algorithms . We found a series of markers on the top of each frame . - Are you ready ? - Yeah , go ahead ! Send it , Willie . Here it comes . It 's digital ... ... massive amounts of data which extend right to the higher harmonics . Jackpot ! All right , as you 'll see ... ... interlaced with the frames of the original Hitler image ... ... we found these sections . We thought they were noise , but they 're actually data ... ... huge amounts of it . When we combine this with the data from the original signal ... ... we get these encrypted pages of text . No two are alike and we've uncovered over 10,000 already . What does it mean , Doctor ? We have no idea . It could be anything . Volume 1 of an Encyclopedia Galactica . Instructions for us on their colonization procedures . Moses with a few billion new commandments . How long will it take to decode it ? It could take forever . We really need a primer ... We need to get the best decryption people we have . I intend to use the VLA as my command post . In the meantime , my office has made out a preliminary budget . Wait a minute . This is a privately-funded operation . We lease dish time from the government ... This is a clear-cut case of eminent domain . I 'm recommending to the President we militarize this project . What ? ! This is my project ! Nobody knows more about this than I do . David , tell them ... Excuse me ! Could we calm down here ? I 'm going to recommend that Dr. Drumlin coordinate the decryption effort . But in light of Dr. Arroway's long experience in these matters ... ... for the time being , she will direct operations at the VLA ... ... understanding that future discoveries will be kept in strict confidence ... ... until such time as the President ... ... can decide the most suitable course of action . Understood ? Yes . This is CNN Breaking News . The President called the message from Vega ... ... '' a stunning insight into our universe ... `` Attendance at religious services has risen a dramatic ... as police clashed with neo-Nazi protesters . So , there 's life on other planets . Boy , this will really change the Miss Universe contest . Health officials worldwide are concerned that the message from Vega ... ... might trigger a rash of mass suicides ... ... not unlike recent cult deaths near San Diego ... Even a scientist must admit ... ... there are some pretty serious religious overtones to all this . Here 's someone whose organization ... ... is accused of conducting its own inquisition : Richard Rank , head of the Conservative Coalition . Thank you . This is yet another example of science intruding into matters of faith . This means they have been reacting to TV signals ... ... from the 1930 's . They 're just getting them . Imagine how disappointed they 'll be if they 're Cubs fans . We now go to Jeremy Roth , who is reporting ... ... from the Very Large Array near Socorro , New Mexico . Like a bolt from the blue it came . `` The Message from Vega '' has caused ... ... thousands of believers and non-believers ... ... to descend upon the VLA facility here in the desert of New Mexico . Many have come to protest , many to pray ... ... but most have come to participate in what 's become the best show in town . Well , I saw the thing coming out of the sky It had one long horn and one big eye I commenced to shaking and said Oo-ee Looks like a Purple People Eater to me Hail to Vega Hail to Vega But they have failed ! It 's the same people who , again and again ... ... have brought us to the brink of destruction ! Who 've polluted our air , who 've poisoned our water ! Now these scientists ... ... have had their chance . Are these the kind of people ... ... that you want talking to your God for you ? Efforts continue around the clock . But for now , almost 2 full weeks after the message 's arrival ... ... scientists here at the VLA still have no answers ... ... only more questions . Jeremy Roth , CNN , Socorro , New Mexico . More on the quest for the message 's meaning , after this . They have to line up somehow . This one does n't fit , either . We 've tried over a million permutations . Always , I can only get three corners to fit . I do n't understand their significance . Somebody broke in ... Hello ? Whoever you are , you broke into the database ... What ? Now ? Where ? I 'll be there . You should feel fortunate . He hardly lands for anyone . Dr. Arroway . I presume ? Mr. Hadden . I 've had my eye on you a long time , Doctor . I consider you one of my most valuable long-term investments . And when it comes to my investments ... ... I always do my homework . Eleanor Ann Arroway ... ... born 25th August , 1964 ... ... De Pere , Wisconsin . Mother , Joanna , died from complications during childbirth . Early testing indicated high predisposition ... ... towards science and mathematics . Father , Theodore ... ... advised to provide enrichment activities in these areas ... ... did so conscientiously until his death ... ... from myocardial infarction , November 10 , 1974 . You graduated from high school in 1979 ... ... almost two full years early . Awarded full scholarship , M.I.T ... ... graduated magna cum laude . Doctoral work , Cal Tech ... ... where you worked on the lanthanide-doped ruby maser ... ... dramatically increasing the sensitivity of radio telescopes . Subsequently offered a teaching position at Harvard University ... ... which you turned down to pursue SETI work ... ... at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico . Changes in N.S.F . policy ... ... gave rise to certain funding problems ... ... at which point ... ... you came to my attention . You compromised our security codes . Once upon a time ... ... I was a hell of an engineer . Please , sit , Doctor . I have guests so rarely , it's important they feel welcome in my home . You live here ? I find it convenient to keep my interests ... ... mobile . Anyway , I 've had my fill of life on the ground . I guess I should ... I guess I should thank you for having bailed me out all that time . I know a good bet when I see one . Earl Grey . No sugar , no milk , I believe . What am I doing here ? The powers that be have been very busy lately ... ... positioning themselves ... ... for the game of the millennium . Maybe I can help deal you back in . I did n't realize that I was out . No . Maybe not out ... ... but certainly being handed your hat . I 've had a long time to make enemies , Doctor . There are many governments ... ... business interests ... ... even religious leaders that would like to see me depart this earth . And I 'll grant them their wish soon enough . But before I do , I wish to make a small contribution . A final gesture of goodwill to the people of this planet who have given ... ... from whom I have taken so much . You found the primer . Clever girl ! Lights . Pages and pages of data . Over 63,000 in all . And on the perimeter of each ... Alignment symbols , registration marks , but they do n't line up . They do ... ... if you think like a Vegan . An alien intelligence has got be more advanced ... ... and that means efficiency functioning on multiple levels ... ... and in multiple ... ... dimensions . Yes , of course ! Where 's the primer ? You 'll see . Every three-dimensional page contains a piece of the primer . There it was all the time , staring you in the face . Buried within the message itself is the key to decoding it . Within the layering of the matrix , we have these basic equations : So with this very elementary foundation , they have given us a kind of ... ... general scientific vocabulary . We now have the symbols for true and false ... This was the key ... ... that allowed us to decipher their language ... ... for physics , geometry , chemistry . Next frame , Ellie . Yes , and when we apply this to the rest of the message ... ... we find this . Those look like engineering schematics , almost like blueprints . Yes . It is our belief that the message contains instructions ... ... for building something , some kind of machine . A machine ? That does what , Doctor ? We do n't know . It might be some type ... ... of advanced communication device , or a teaching machine of some kind . Or it might be ... ... some kind of a transport . - Transport ? - There 's no proof of that . The fact is you do n't know what it does . It could be anything . A Trojan Horse . We build it and out pours the entire Vegan army . Why risk the personnel ? It could be a weapon . Right . Some kind of a Doomsday Machine . Every time they detect a new civilization ... ... they fax construction plans from space . We poor saps build this thing and blow ourselves to kingdom come . There 's no reason to believe their intentions are hostile . Why is it the egghead position that aliens are always benign ? We pose no threat to them . It 'd be like us going out of our way ... ... to destroy microbes on an anthill . Interesting analogy . How guilty would we feel if we destroyed a few microbes on an anthill ? I hope you 're right . I really do . But my job is to protect American lives from any threat ... ... so I am obligated to assume the worst . Yes , and I am forced to agree with you . My problem is this : The content of that message is morally ambiguous at best . Our internal numbers show support for this is incredibly soft . If the President stays this course ... ... his numbers will be going south like ducks in winter . This is nuts ! Excuse me ... ... Miss . We know nothing of these creatures ' values . We do n't even know whether they believe in God . This does n't make any sense . If ... Excuse me , Dr. Arroway . We wo n't be suppressing any opinions here today . No , of course not . I understand . What I meant to say ... ... is the message was written in the language of science . If it was religious in nature , it should have taken the form ... ... of a burning bush or a voice from the sky . But a voice from the sky ... ... is exactly what you found , Doctor Arroway . I 'm sorry I 'm late , ma'am . I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable ... ... religious implications at stake . But that does n't justify being an alarmist . I hope that we can find a common ground ... ... break through obstacles that may have kept us apart . Listen , I need to make one thing very clear . Our organization will not be placated with flowery New Age rhetoric ... Mr. President ! The President met with top advisors ... ... regarding the latest efforts to decode the message . While there has been some progress , the official line remains cautious . If you 're asking when we 'll find out ... ... what the purpose of that Machine is ... ... maybe tomorrow , maybe next year , maybe never . There he is . The man with his finger on the nation's spiritual pulse . It 's so good to see you . You too . Your discovery , all of this . It must be a real vindication . I 'm really happy for you . Are you ? Mr. Joss , the President 's waiting . The President 's waiting . See you at the reception ? Yeah , I would n't miss it . Miss Constantine , may I speak to you ? Certainly . I have a big problem . Do you know where I can find a really great dress ? God created man in the form of Himself , not in the form of monkeys ! Get a job ! Don't waste my tax dollars ! You look beautiful , Ellie . - So do you . - You really do . I read your book . Here we go . You want me to quote you ? `` Ironically ... ... the thing people are most hungry for ... ... meaning ... ... is the one thing science has n't been able to give them. `` Yeah . It 's like you 're saying that ... ... science killed God . What if science simply revealed ... ... that He never existed in the first place ? I think we need to get some air . And a few more of these . Thank you . A little chilly out here . Yeah , this is nice . I got one for you . Occam 's Razor . Ever heard of it ? Occam 's Razor . Sounds like some slasher movie . No , Occam 's Razor is a basic scientific principle which says : Things being equal , the simplest explanation tends to be right . Makes sense to me . So what 's more likely ? Thank you . An all-powerful God created the universe ... ... then decided not to give any proof of His existence ? Or ... ... that He does n't exist at all and that we created Him ... ... so we would n't feel so small and alone . I do n't know . I could n't imagine living in a world where God did n't exist . I would n't want to . How do you know you're not deluding yourself ? I mean , for me ... ... I 'd need proof . Proof ? Did you love your father ? Your dad , did you love him ? Yes . Very much . Prove it . Kent . The White House . No excuses . Whoever 's responsible , I want their head on a platter . What happened ? You were right all along . The team at the VLA has worked around the clock ... ... and the hard work has finally paid off . This key section uncovered tonight , and obtained exclusively by CNN ... ... shows an illustration of a human figure ... ... inside a geometric structure of some kind . This and other contextual clues ... ... now lead scientists to believe the message is , in fact ... - President called an emergency meeting . - I imagined he would . ... designed to take a single human occupant into space ... ... presumably to the star Vega . Tell me . They will build it . Who goes ? The President's gone international to spread the risk and cost ... Who goes ? Well , it 's complicated . They have formed a group of international candidates . Now , it 's your discovery . They understand that . You're at the top of a very short list . But they 're also forming a selection committee . It 's made of scholars , theologians , scientists , philosophers ... You 're on it . I 've been asked , yes . I guess that means ... ... that you 're a selector , I 'm a selectee and we ca n't ... Yeah . What you don't understand , Ellie , is ... I understand . I want you to know , whatever happens , as far as I 'm concerned ... Good luck . Whatever you do , make sure he does n't monopolize the committee . He is not on the committee , Ellie . He just resigned . He wants to be the one to go . The President is already feeling the financial pinch . Sources say the cost of the project is spiralling ... ... to more than a third of a trillion dollars ... ... making this perhaps the most expensive single project ... ... in all of human history . Months of debate finally reached ... ... a conclusion last week as 10 candidates were selected by the I.M.C ... ... representing a cross section of political and religious views . Many are the same experts who have consulted ... ... on the Machine's design and function . They will actively participate on-site , during the construction process . The choice of these 10 candidates has been controversial . One-third of the candidates are American . And many international observers ask why . The U.S. is shouldering a large part of the cost ... Is n't it true that contractors , like Hadden Industries ... ... are making contributions in exchange for technology rights ? Different nations are being compensated in different ways . Japan made headlines by opting to forego candidate representation ... ... in exchange for the systems integration subcontract . On what basis do you choose ... ... a human being to represent humanity ? Good question , Larry . If nothing else ... ... it should be somebody fluent in the language the message was given in . Science , in this case . Despite your obvious enthusiasm ... ... there 's been a lot of criticism ... ... that this endeavor is simply too dangerous . Some of that criticism from scientists . One Nobel Prize winner noted , his words : '' There is every indication ... ... that this is beyond our capabilities , that this endeavor will fail ... ... and that the Machine 's occupant will pay for it with his life. `` How do you respond ? This message is from a civilization that may be anywhere ... ... from hundreds to millions and millions of years ahead of us . I have to believe that an intelligence that advanced ... ... knows what they 're doing . Now all it requires on our part is ... Faith ? I was going to say , a sense of adventure . And in breaking news ... ... astronaut John Russell ... ... considered to be the leading American candidate for the Machine seat ... ... has dropped out of the running . Russell met with reporters today at his Houston home . I told my dad I did n't want him ... ... to go . Daddy , do n't go . Nothing would give me more pride ... ... than to ... ... represent my country . But what can I say to this ? Consortium officials had no comment , but inside sources ... ... have disclosed that Dr. Arroway ... ... appears to now be the front-runner for the Machine seat . `` Meet me at noon . Must talk. `` I did n't expect a message like this from you . Thanks for coming . Is this kosher ? Fraternizing with the enemy ? Selectors and selectees mingling around ? Can we talk about Einstein ? Yeah , sure . Special relativity . This Machine ... ... if it works , you travel to Vega at the speed of light . - When you come back ... - If you come back . If you come back ... ... you 'll be 4 years older , but over passed here on Earth . Basically . And everybody that you care about ... ... will be gone , dead and buried . If you came back , if you survived at all ... Look , Palmer , nobody's saying this is n't dangerous . The rest of the candidates and myself understand the risks we 're taking . Why ? It 's a historic opportunity . The world needs ... You , Ellie . You ! You personally . By doing this , you're willing to give your life . You 're willing to die for it . Why ? From as long as I can remember , I 've been searching for ... ... something ... ... some reason why we 're here . What are we doing here ? Who are we ? If this is a chance to find out even a part of that answer ... I do n't know , I think it 's worth a human life . Do n't you ? You 're an incredibly brave woman , Ellie . Or incredibly nuts . I 'm really confused . So am I. I think I speak for us all when I thank you for your patience . Myself , I have one final question , Dr. Arroway . If you should meet these Vegans ... ... and were permitted only one question to ask of them ... ... what would it be ? I suppose it would be : '' How did you do it ? How did you evolve ? How did you survive technological adolescence ... ... without destroying yourself ? '' That more than any other question is one I personally would like answered . Not too bad , Mike . I join Dr. Bergeron ... ... in expressing thanks for your patience , Dr. Arroway . We 're all impressed with your candor ... ... and your stamina . I think we 're ready to move on to your final statement . I have one more question . Yes , Mr. Joss . Would you consider yourself ... ... a spiritual person ? I do n't understand the point of the question . I consider myself a moral person . We 're sure that 's the case , but what Mr. Joss is in fact asking ... Do you believe in God ? As a scientist ... ... I rely on empirical evidence , and in this matter ... ... I do n't believe that there 's data either way . So your answer would in fact be that you do n't believe in God . I do n't understand the relevance of the question . population ... ... believes in a Supreme Being in one form or another . I believe that makes the question more than relevant . I believe ... I believe I 've already answered that question . I 'm proud of what we've achieved as a species ... ... and as a civilization . I would hate to see everything we stand for ... ... all that we have fought for for a thousand generations ... ... all that God has blessed us with ... ... betrayed ... ... in the final hour because we sent a representative who did not put our ... ... most cherished beliefs first . Thank you . Why 'd you do it ? Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody . I could n't in good conscience vote for a person ... ... who does n't believe in God . Someone who ... ... honestly thinks the other 95 % of us ... ... suffer from some form of mass delusion . I told the truth up there . Drumlin told you exactly what you wanted to hear . With full humility and utmost gratitude ... ... I accept this great honor ... ... and I promise I will do my best to represent my nation ... ... my planet and my God on this historic ... ... journey . I thank you from the bottom of my heart . There 's a carnival atmosphere at Cape Canaveral ... ... as the International Machine Consortium ... ... hosts as much a media event as a systems test . David Drumlin is supervising the on-site portion of the test . We spoke with him earlier today . We 'll be able to monitor the stresses and effects using the robot passenger ... ... who we lovingly call Elmer . The press wants to ask you a few questions ... ... as soon as they're done with Dr. Drumlin . When we release the pod , a substantial amount of energy will be generated . We 'll be able to monitor the stresses and effects ... ... using our robot passenger , who we ... ... lovingly call Elmer . Thank you . You 're welcome . They 're ready for you out at the site . Yeah , just a minute . - Congratulations . - Glad you could come . Did n't expect to see you here . Well , I 'm still ... ... Crew Ops at the Control Center . I suppose the fact that I discovered the message means I have PR value . Of course . I know you must think this is all very unfair . And maybe that's an understatement . What you don't know is , I agree . I wish the world was a place where fair was the bottom line ... ... where the idealism you showed at the hearing was rewarded ... ... not taken advantage of . Unfortunately , we don't live in that world . Funny ... ... I always believed the world is what we make of it . Excuse me ! Good luck on the test . Thank you . Test director ... ... everything looks good . Ready to go . I want things double and triple checked here . We only get one shot at this . Let 's get it right . Ladies and gentlemen , we are ready for start-up . All controllers , I need a go-no-go for test initiation . - Mechanical ? - Go . Electrical ? Dynamics ? Communications ? Pod systems ? Safety ? Crew Ops , verify all pre-test procedures are complete . Yes , verified . I 'm go . Pad Leader , is everything okay with you ? Roger . The pad is a go . Test initiation , on my mark . ... 4 ... ... 3 ... ... 2 ... ... 1 . Mark . - Test start . - Rings are unlocked . Power levels show a good start . We 've begun the test of ... ... earth 's first system built by sharing knowledge with a neighbor in space . All power sources on core induction bus . IPV power transfer . Ring motion detect . Alpha , Bravo , Charlie . - Gerry , how are we looking ? - Looks good . We 're underway . Looks like a normal start-up . Roger , David . It's looking good here . We are moments away from the initiation of the drop sequence . All systems are go . - Mechanical , you still happy ? - Roger . It 's very exciting ... ... from up here . We 've got 4 % . We 're confirming 4 % . Frequency 9.85 . Harmonics in the green . G-level 1.1 . - 5 % . - Confirmed . We are at 5 % . David , how 's it looking to you ? Okay . I 'm going to take a look and show you what we got . Instrumentation looks good . We have a good picture from Dr. Drumlin 's PRD . Hope you guys are seeing what I 'm seeing . All systems are go . This is really something ! For purposes of this test ... ... Dr. Drumlin will be on top of the Gantry crane that's over the Machine . We 've got some video animation ... ... to show just how this Machine ... it is thought ... will work . The passenger pod will release . It will come down through the center of the rings and into the Machine 's core . The question everyone here is asking is ... ... what happens then ? Some believe the rings function as some sort of an accelerator or something ... ... sending its energy into the pod ... ... making it rocket away at near light speed . Others believe it might open up a doorway to some other dimension . Who 's right ? That 's what today's test is all about . - 35 % . - Subsystems ready ? Confirm 40 % . Controllers stand by to initiate drop sequence ... ... on my mark . All systems ready for drop sequence . We 're in 45 % . Verify closure . All controllers stand by to initiate IPV drop sequence . On my mark . I 'm feeling a very strange vibration . - Are you feeling it down there ? - Gerry , can you confirm ? Everything looks good . Crew Ops ? Nothing wrong . We see nothing abnormal here . No good . Hold sequence . I 'll take a direct reading . What 's he talking about ? Can anyone say grandstanding ? He sure knows he 's on TV ! Back home that 's what we call an overcooked ham . I 'm reading 10 kilohertz ! What do you read on the first and second order G-levels ? G-levels are right on ! We confirm Drumlin's readings . All normal . We 're go . I think we 're okay , but we 'll let him finish . - Mechanical , you still okay ? - Roger . Right on the money . Security problem ! Ellie , are you sure ? He should n't be there . I know him . Gerry , execute the rapid shutdown sequence . Security , move emergency response team into position . Get Drumlin on a secure loop . You got him . - Can you hear me ? - Yes , I hear . We 've got a security breach here . Behind you . The tall guy . The technician . See him ? He should n't be there . Something 's in his hand ! Him ! Take him ! Security breach ! A bomb ! I want that emergency response team up on the gantry . Now ! Stage One Alert ! Move all fire and rescue personnel into position one . All right , back to your stations . I need you to be professional . Settle down ! Pad Leader , do you copy ? The scene earlier today , when David Drumlin ... ... advisor to two Presidents ... ... and winner of the National Academy of Sciences lifetime award ... ... was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery . In a related story ... Can I help you ? I 've got some mail for you . ... the apparent suicide note of the terrorist now believed responsible ... ... for the explosion in Florida this week . What we do ... ... we do for the goodness of all mankind . This wo n't be understood , not now ... ... but the Apocalypse to come ... ... will vindicate our faith . Welcome home . Comrade Arroway ... ... we have been expecting your call . One moment , please . Mr. Hadden ? Doctor ! How kind of you to call . Mr. Hadden , where are you ? The Russian government was kind enough to give me accommodations on Mir . You 're living on a space station ? It 's quite simple , really . The low oxygen , zero gravity environment ... ... is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive . Actually , I quite like it up here . My little room has one hell of a view . I want to show you something . Hokkaido Island . The systems integration site . Look closer . First rule in government spending : Why build one when you can have two at twice the price ? Only , this one can be kept secret . Controlled by Americans ... ... built by Japanese subcontractors ... ... who also happen to be ... ... recently acquired ... ... wholly-owned subsidiaries ... ... of Hadden Industries . They still want an American to go , Doctor . Want to take a ride ? Augmenting our restraint and ... ... communications console subsystem ... ... is your personal recording unit . Normal , infrared and ultraviolet lenses . Digital microchip good for thousands of hours of recording . Okay , look , I understand ... ... the reason for recording and documenting the mission . But I just want to go on record one more time . The transmitted specs never said anything about any chair ... ... or a restraining harness ... ... or survival gear . Why ca n't we just trust the original ... Doctor , both the IMC Board and the SI team reviewed the material ... ... and concluded that the design impact is negligible . Bottom line is ... ... we 're not putting anyone aboard this Machine ... ... unless there is some sort of minimal protection . End of story . We 've given these to the astronauts since the start of the space program . It 's never been made public , of course . It 's fast and it 's painless . I 'm going to travel 26 light years to commit suicide ? Something may go wrong . There may be an unforeseen mechanical failure . You could be marooned , unable to return . There are 1,000 reasons we can think of to have this ... ... but mostly it 's for the reasons we ca n't think of . Come in . Dr. Arroway , time to get ready . Thank you . I know there 's not much time . As soon as I found out about it , I called the President . I came with Kitz . I had to see you one more time . Oh , God , I 'm sorry . No , I 'm glad you came . There 's something I got to say to you . The reason I did n't vote for you was a good one , but not the real one . I did n't vote for you to go ... ... because I don't want to lose you . Now you find your way home , all right ? ... was stunned by the announcement of the existence of another Machine ... ... and its passenger , Eleanor Ann Arroway . Now ... ... the question that's on everyone 's mind : Will history repeat itself ? With a piece of engineering this complex ... ... with so many unknowns , could the unthinkable occur ? The security in Hokkaido has been incredibly tight . No reporters whatsoever have been allowed near the site . Restraint secure . Life support functions normal . Roger . This is Control . Do you copy ? Reading you five-by-five . Give me Ellie 's PRD . Video unit recording and transmitting . - Are you reading me ? - That 's affirmative . Video looks good . Copy , Control . Ellie , we 're going to proceed to button you up . I 'm ready . Confirming walkway retraction . - Communications ? - Go . - Life support ? - Go . We are go for closure . I 'm go here . Mechanical , initiate IPV closure sequence . Let me get you a chair . - It 's nice to smell you again , Mr. Kitz . - You too . Would n't peg him as a Polo man . I got a visual on the door . The door is looking good . Door alignment looks good . We 're green across the board . Copy that , Control . IPV is secure . We are at 30 % . Copy that , 30 % . How you doing in there ? Kent ? Is that you ? That 's a big affirmative . Who let you in there ? A higher power intervened . I 'm glad you came . Copy that , 35 % . - Mechanical ? - We 're good . I 'm picking up a moderate vibration . Dynamics , can you confirm vibration ? It looks good here . She 's feeling the same thing they felt at the Cape . Vibration 's normal . We are at 50 % . All systems nominal . Copy that , 50 % . Vibration 's a little stronger now . We 're picking up some low frequency noise . Mechanical , confirm ? It looks fine to me . Roger . Jerry , what do you think ? I 'm still go . People , we are still go . Something 's happening . You see that light ? I 'm seeing ... I ca n't tell if it 's daylight . There it is again . It's coming from the bottom . Let me show you . See that ? Negative . You 're breaking up . - Can we boost signal ? - It 's at maximum . The material is changing . It 's bordering on translucence . The system 's intact . It has to be ... ... some kind of electromagnetic field . Do you read this ? We see only interference . It 's becoming translucent . I ca n't describe it . I ca n't even explain it ! We have intermittent comm , but we are go ! Initiate secondary drive systems . Initiating auxiliary booster sequence . We 're go for ignition . We have auxiliary ignition . Life support , how is she ? Heart and respiration are high but within limits . Ellie , do you copy ? If you hear ... ... I am okay to go . All vibration and G-levels are in the green . Control , if you're reading me ... ... I am okay to go ! Okay to go ! All tips are on the profile . structural instability . - Is she holding ? - We 're within limits , barely . I 'm okay to go ! I 'm okay to go ! My God ! Okay to go ! I 'm okay ! Tremendous EMI levels around Machine ! Field measurements are off-scale . We 're approaching our abort limits . Okay to go . I hear her ! I hear her . Barely , but she 's there . Okay to go . Says she 's okay to go . Steve , we 're real close . - Your core reading ? - Internal environment looks normal . Inside the core , the weather 's beautiful . I 'm okay to go . I 'm okay to go . Initiate drop sequence . On my mark . ... 9 ... ... 8 ... ... 7 ... ... 6 ... ... 5 ... ... 4 ... ... 3 ... ... 2 ... I 'm okay to go . Oh , God ! Ellie to Control . Ellie to Control , do you read me ! Ellie to Control , do you read me ! I 'll try ... ... to keep recording ! I 'm going through ... ... some kind of a tunnel ! There 's a light source ahead ! Brilliant ... ... blue-white . Residual radiation ? It 's a star . I must have ... ... gone through a wormhole . It 's Vega ! I 'm in another wormhole now ! I had no idea ! A series of them ! They 're alive . It 's like ... ... some kind of a transit system . A subway ! Oh , God ! I have to keep talking . It 's a triple ... ... no , a quadruple system . Beautiful ! They 're alive ! Another wormhole ! This one 's much more violent ! Some ... ... celestial event ... No ! No words ! No words ... ... to describe it ! Poetry ! They should have sent ... ... a poet . It 's so beautiful ! Beautiful ! So beautiful . I had no idea . Hi , Sparks . Dad ? I missed you . Are n't you ... ? I 'm sorry I could n't be there for you , sweetheart . You 're not real . None of this is real ! That 's my scientist . When I was unconscious , you downloaded my thoughts , my memories . Pensacola ! We thought it might make things easier for you . Why did you contact us ? You contacted us . We were just listening . There are others ? Many others . They all ... ... travel here through that transit system you built ? We did n't build it . We do n't know who did . They were gone long before we ever got here . Maybe someday they 'll come back . All the civilizations you find come here ? Not all . - Is this some test ? - No , no test . You have your mother 's hands . You 're an interesting species ... ... an interesting mix . You 're capable of such beautiful dreams ... ... and such horrible nightmares . You feel so lost ... ... so cut off , so alone . Only you 're not . In all our searching ... ... all we 've found that makes the emptiness bearable ... ... is each other . What happens now ? Now ? You go home . Home ? But ... ... I have so many questions . Do we get to come back ? This was just a first step . In time , you 'll take another . But other people need to see what I 've seen ... This is the way it 's been done for billions of years . Small moves , Ellie . Small moves . We 've got video on Ellie ! She 's through ! She is in the net . She 's alive . Get the President on the phone ! What 's going on ? How is she ? Ellie , this is Control . You copy ? - What 's going on ? - I do n't know . - She 's alive . - Put her on P.A . Ellie , hold on tight . We 're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction ... ... but the important thing is you 're okay . What ? It 's all right . The important thing is you 're safe . What malfunction ? What happened ? What day is this ? I 'm sorry . Did you say what day ? How long was I gone ? The IPV dropped straight through the Machine . You did n't go anywhere . But I did . I did go . That 's what I've tried to tell everyone . But the headset didn't record a single image ? Just this . Static . Thank you . Let me show you what we saw . show exactly the same event . The IPV dropped straight through . Everyone saw exactly ... ... the same thing . Nothing happened . How do you explain this , Doctor ? I ca n't . I 'd encourage you ... ... not to inflame this situation ... ... beyond the facts . Let us deal with this on the facts . We are monitoring what has actually happened . We are taking what we believe are factually ... ... appropriate steps . Amid a flurry of accusations and counter-accusations ... ... by the nations representing the Machine Consortium ... ... the President has ordered a special inquiry . But the appointment to the committee of Michael Kitz ... ... who has resigned as National Security Advisor ... ... has raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill . I have made no decision to run for Congress , announced no candidacy . I resigned as National Security Advisor ... ... in order to devote all of my energy to this inquiry . The people of the world have a right to know what really happened . Yet every scientific instrument confirms ... ... the IPV was out of contact for only a fraction of a second . Is n't that correct , Doctor ? A fraction of a second Earth time , yes . Earth time ? Senator , I believe that the Machine opened up a wormhole ... ... a tunnel through space-time , also known as an Einstein-Rossen Bridge . Due to the effect of general relativity , what I experienced as 18 hours ... ... passed instantaneously on Earth . Is n't it true these wormholes are merely theoretical predictions ? There is no evidence they actually exist ? There is no direct evidence , no . Tell me ... ... why would these aliens go to all this trouble ? Bring you thousands of light years , then send you home without proof ? They said it 's how it 's been done for billions of years . You have no proof because they did n't want you to have any . A phenomenon known in psychiatric circles as a self-reinforcing delusion . You think I was delusional ? I do think you may have suffered some kind of an episode . Yes , I do . I 'd like to propose an alternate hypothesis ... ... and I 'd like you to bring your scientific expertise to bear on it . To fake a signal from Vega ... ... what would you need ? You 'd need a satellite to transmit it , but it would be impossible to ... You 'd need a satellite and launch capabilities to orbit it . And the message itself . To put something like this together ... ... so complex , drawing on many disciplines ... Would be impossible . Impossible ? Is there anyone who might have been up to the challenge ? Someone with extraordinary technical expertise ... ... enormous financial resources ... ... someone perverse enough , eccentric enough to come up with the idea ? Hadden ? S. R. Hadden . You 're implying that this was ... ... some kind of a hoax ? That he engineered this ? S. R. Hadden ... ... a legendary power broker in perhaps his final bid for immortality . Maybe he wanted to exploit new technologies ... ... having world governments pick up the tab . Perhaps this was his final altruistic gesture ... ... to unite the world in some common goal . Maybe all of the above . S. R. Hadden , a brilliant ... ... and complicated man . Doctor , are you familiar with the scientific precept ... ... known as Occam 's Razor ? Yes . It means the simplest explanation generally tends to be the right one . Exactly . You tell me . What is more likely here ? A message from aliens results in a magical machine ... ... that whisks you to the center of the galaxy ... ... to windsurf with Dad and a split second later ... ... returns you home without a single shred of proof ? Or that your experience is the result of being ... ... the unwitting star in the farewell performance of one ... ... S.R . Hadden ? A man with the means and motive to play you and all of us ... ... as pawns in the most elaborate , most expensive hoax of all time ? You come to us with no evidence , no records ... ... no artifacts ... ... only a story that , to put it mildly , strains credibility . Over half a trillion dollars were spent . Dozens of lives were lost . Are you going to sit there and tell us we should just take this all ... ... on faith ? Please answer the question , Doctor . Is it possible that it did n't happen ? Yes . As a scientist I must concede that . I must volunteer that . Let me get this straight . You admit you have no physical evidence to back up your story ? Yes . You admit you may have hallucinated this whole thing ? You admit if you were in our position ... ... you would be as incredulous and skeptical as we ? Then why don't you simply withdraw your testimony and concede ... ... that this journey to the center of the galaxy never took place ? Because I ca n't . I had an experience . I ca n't prove it . I ca n't even explain it . But everything I know as a human being , everything I am ... ... tells me it was real . I was given something wonderful , something that changed me forever . A vision ... ... of the universe ... ... that tells us undeniably ... ... how tiny and insignificant ... ... and how rare and precious we all are . A vision that tells us that we belong to something ... ... that is greater than ourselves , that none of us are alone . I wish I could share that . I wish ... ... that everyone , if even for one ... ... moment ... ... could feel ... ... that awe and humility and hope . That continues to be my wish . Dr. Arroway , can I get a picture , please . Reverend Joss ! What do you believe ? ! As a person of faith , I 'm bound by a different covenant than Dr. Arroway . But our goal is one and the same . The pursuit of truth . I , for one , believe her . So what happens now ? We give her a medal ? I 'd say at least a healthy grant . You read the confidential report from the investigating committee ? I flipped through it . I was very interested in the section on Arroway 's video unit . The one that recorded the static . Continue . The fact that it recorded static is n't what interests me . Continue . What interests me ... ... is that it recorded approximately 18 hours of it . That is interesting , is n't it ? And you can see over there , we're building 45 brand new dishes . That means when you put them together with all the radio telescopes ... ... all over the world ... ... we 'll hear farther into space than anyone has ever heard before . Are there other people out there in the universe ? That 's a good question . What do you think ? I do n't know . That 's a good answer . Skeptic , huh ? The important thing is that you all keep searching for your own answers . One thing about the universe , though . The universe ... ... is a pretty big place . It 's bigger than anything ... ... anyone has ever dreamed of before . So if it 's just us ... ... it seems like an awful waste of space . Right ?
1990;Doc . Doc . -Doc ! -What ? Relax , Doc . It 's me ! It 's Marty . It ca n't be . I just sent you back to the future . You did send me back to the future , but I 'm back . I 'm back from the future . Great Scott ! Hey , kids , what time is it ? Howdy Doody time ! `` It 's Howdy Doody time '' Great Scott ! Howdy Doody time ? Sunday , November 13 , 1955 , 7:01 a.m. Last night 's time travel experiment was apparently a complete success . Lightning struck the clock tower at 10:04 p.m ... ... sending the necessary 1.21 gigawatts ... ... into the time vehicle , which vanished in a flash of light ... ... leaving a pair of fire trails behind . I assumed Marty and the time vehicle ... ... were transported forward through time to the year 1985 . After that , I ca n't recall what happened . In fact , I do n't even remember how I got home . Perhaps the gigawatt discharge and the temporal displacement field ... ... generated by the vehicle caused a disruption of my own brain waves ... ... resulting in a condition of momentary amnesia . I now recall that moments after the time vehicle disappeared ... ... into the future ... ... I saw a vision of Marty saying he had come back from the future . Hey , Doc . Undoubtedly , this was some residual image . Doc , calm down . It 's me . It 's Marty . It ca n't be you . I sent you back to the future ! That 's right , but I came back again from the future . Do n't you remember ? You fainted . I brought you home . This ca n't be happening ! You ca n't be here ! It does n't make sense ! I refuse to believe you are here ! I am here , and it does make sense . I came back to 1955 again with you . The you from 1985 is waiting to get a book from Biff ! Once I got the book , the you from 1985 were in the DeLorean ... ... and it got struck by lightning , and you got sent back to 1885 ! It 's a very interesting story , future boy ... ... but there 's one thing that does n't make sense . If the me of the future is now in the past , how could you possibly know about it ? You sent me a letter . `` Dear Marty , if my calculations are correct ... '' ... you will receive this letter immediately after the DeLorean 's struck by lightning . `` First , let me assure you I am alive and well . `` I 've been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885 . `` The lightning bolt that hit the DeLorean ... '' ... caused an overload which scrambled the time circuits ... '' ... activated the flux capacitor and sent me back to 1885 . `` The overload shorted out the time circuits ... '' ... and destroyed the flying circuits . Unfortunately , the car will never fly again . '' It actually flew ? Yeah . We had a hover conversion done in the early 21st century . Incredible ! `` I set myself up as a blacksmith as a front ... '' ... while I attempted to repair the damage to the time circuits . `` Unfortunately , this proved impossible ... '' ... because suitable replacement parts will not be invented until 1947 . `` However , I 've gotten quite adept at shoeing horses and fixing wagons . '' I actually end up as a blacksmith in the Old West . Pretty heavy . `` I have buried the DeLorean in the abandoned Delgado Mine ... '' ... adjacent to the old Boot Hill Cemetery as shown on the enclosed map . `` Hopefully , it should remain undisturbed and preserved until you uncover it in 1955 . `` Inside , you will find repair instructions . `` My 1955 counterpart ... '' That 's me . `` Should have no problem repairing it so that you can drive it back to the future . `` Once you have returned to 1985 , destroy the time machine . '' -Destroy it ? -It 's a long story , Doc . `` I repeat , do not attempt to come back here to get me . `` I am perfectly happy living in the fresh air ... '' ... and wide-open spaces . `` I fear that unnecessary time travel ... '' ... only risks further disruption of the space-time continuum . `` And please take care of Einstein for me . '' Einstein ? He 's your dog , Doc . Einstein is what you call your dog in 1985 . `` I know you will give him a good home . `` Remember to walk him twice a day and that he only likes canned dog food . `` These are my wishes . Please respect and follow them . `` And so , Marty , I now say farewell and wish you Godspeed . `` You 've been a good , kind , and loyal friend to me ... '' ... and you made a real difference in my life . `` I will always treasure our relationship and think of you with fond memories ... '' ... warm feelings and a special place in my heart . `` Your friend in time , Doc Emmett L. Brown . `` September 1 , 1885 . '' I never knew I could write anything so touching . I know , it 's beautiful . It 's all right , Copernicus . Everything will be fine . I 'm sorry . It 's all my fault you 're stuck back there . I never should 've let Biff get to me . There are plenty worse places to be than the Old West . I could have ended up in the Dark Ages . They probably would have burned me at the stake as a heretic . Let 's look at the map . According to this , the time vehicle is sealed off in a side tunnel . We may have to blast . Whoa ! I think you woke up the dead with that blast . Take this camera . I want to document everything ! This reminds me of the time I attempted to reach the center of the Earth . I 'd been reading my favorite author , Jules Verne . I spent weeks preparing that expedition . I did n't even get this far . Of course , I was only 12 at the time . You know , it was the writings of Jules Verne ... ... that had a profound effect on my life . When I was 11 , I first read It was then that I realized I must devote my life to science . Check it out . Look at this . My initials ! Just like in Journey to the Center of the Earth ! That means the time machine must be right through this wall ! It 's been buried in here for 70 years , two months and 13 days . Astounding ! `` As you see , the lightning bolt shorted out the time-circuit control chip . `` The attached ... '' Schematic . `` Schematic diagram will allow you to build a replacement unit ... '' ... with 1955 components , thus restoring the time machine to perfect working order . '' Unbelievable that this little piece of junk could be such a big problem . No wonder this circuit failed . It says , `` Made in Japan . '' What do you mean , Doc ? All the best stuff is made in Japan . Unbelievable ! You know , when I was a kid , I always wanted to be a cowboy . Now , knowing I 'm spending my future in the past ... ... it sounds like a wonderful way to spend my retirement years . It just occurred to me , since I end up in 1885 ... ... perhaps I 'm now in the history books . I wonder . Could I look myself up in the old newspaper archives ? I do n't know . You always say it 's not good to know too much about your own destiny . You 're right , Marty . I know too much already . Better that I not attempt to uncover the circumstances of my own future . Copernicus . Come on , boy ! I 'll get him . Copernicus ! Come on . Let 's go home , boy . What 's wrong ? What 's wrong , Copernicus ? Come on , let 's go . Doc , come here ! Quick ! What 's wrong ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . You 're not far off , Doc . Great Scott ! Check this out . `` Died September 7 , 1885 . '' That 's one week after you wrote the letter ! `` Erected in eternal memory by his beloved Clara . '' Who the hell is Clara ? -Please do n't stand there ! -Right . Sorry . I have to get another picture . `` Shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of $ 80 '' ? What kind of a future do you call that ? `` Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman ... '' ... whose short temper and a tendency to drool ... '' ... earned him the nickname 'Mad Dog . ' `` He was quick on the trigger and bragged he had killed 12 men ... '' ... not including Indians or Chinamen . '' Does it name me ? Am I one of the 12 ? Wait . `` This claim can not be proven since precise records were not kept ... '' ... after Tannen shot a newspaper editor ... '' ... who printed an unfavorable story about him in 1884 . '' That 's why we ca n't find anything . Look . William McFly and family . Your relatives ? My great-grandfather 's name was William . That 's him . Good-Iooking guy . McFlys , but no Browns . Maybe it was a mistake . Maybe that grave was n't yours . There could 've been another Emmett Brown in 1885 . Did you have any relatives here back then ? The Browns did n't come to Hill Valley until 1908 . Then they were the von Brauns . My father changed our name during World War I . Look . Great Scott , it 's me ! Then it is true , all of it . It is me who goes back there and gets shot . It 's not gon na happen , Doc . After you fix the time circuits and put new tires on the DeLorean ... ... I 'm going back to 1885 , and I 'm bringing you home . The clothes fit ? Everything except the boots . They 're kind of tight . Are you sure this stuff is authentic ? Of course . Have n't you ever seen a Western ? Yeah , I have . Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this . -Clint who ? -Right . You have n't heard of him yet . You have to wear the boots . You ca n't wear those futuristic things back in 1885 . You should n't be wearing them here in 1955 . -As soon as I get there , I 'll put them on . -Okay . I think we 're about ready . I put gas in the tank . Your future clothes are packed . Just in case , fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies . What about that floating device ? Hoverboard . All right . It 's gon na be a long walk back to Hill Valley from here . It 's still the safest plan . We ca n't risk sending you back into a populated area ... ... or to a spot that 's geographically unknown . You do n't want to crash into some tree that existed in the past . This was all completely open country ... ... so you 'll have plenty of runout space when you arrive . Remember , where you 're going , there are no roads . There 's a small cave over there which will be a good place to hide the time vehicle . The new time-circuit control tubes are warmed up . Time circuits on . I wrote the letter on September 1 , so we 'll send you to ... ... September 2 , that 's a Wednesday . September 2 , 1885 , 8:00 a.m . I get shot on Monday the 7th . You have five days to locate me . According to my letter , I 'm a blacksmith , so I probably have a shop somewhere . All you got to do is drive the time vehicle ... ... directly toward that screen , accelerating to 88 miles an hour . Wait a minute . If I drive straight towards the screen , I 'll crash into those Indians . Marty , you 're not thinking fourth dimensionally . You 'll instantly be transported to 1885 and those Indians wo n't even be there . Right . Good luck , for both of our sakes . See you in the future . -You mean the past . -Exactly . Happy trails , Marty ! Ready , Marty ? Ready ! -Set ! -Hi-ho , Silver . Indians ! The cave ! Charge ! Shit ! The cavalry ! Damn , I ripped the fuel line . Maggie ! Fetch some water ! We got a hurt man here . Mom . Mom , is that you ? There , there . You 've been asleep for nearly six hours . I had this horrible nightmare . I dreamed I was in a Western . I was being chased by all these Indians ... ... and a bear . You 're safe and sound now here at the McFly farm . `` McFly farm '' ? You 're my ... You 're my ... -Who are you ? -The name is Maggie McFly . McFly ? Maggie ? And that 's Mrs. McFly , and do n't you be forgetting the `` Mrs. '' What might your name be , sir ? It 's ... Eastwood . Clint Eastwood . You hit your head , Mr. Eastwood . Not too serious , but lucky for you Seamus found you when he did . Seamus . Me husband . You 'll be excusing me , while I tend to William . William . That 's okay , Will . That 's William ? Aye . William Sean McFly , the first of our family to be born in America . It 's okay , Will . This here is Mr. Clint Eastwood visiting . He sure likes you . Maggie . I 've got supper . I 'm not one to pry into a man 's personal affairs ... ... but exactly how is it you came to be way out here ... ... without a horse , or boots , or a hat ? Well , my ... ... horse broke down and a bear ate my boots ... ... and I just forgot my hat . How could you forget a thing like your hat ? -Would you like some water ? -Yeah . I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Mr. Eastwood . I 'll help you find your blacksmith friend . You can stay the night in the barn ... ... and tomorrow I 'll take you as far as the railroad tracks . You can follow them straight into town . I 'll even give you a hat . That 's great . Thanks . That 's my William . Wee Willy . Yes . I think you 'll find the barn comfortable . Never had any complaints about it from the pigs . Seamus . A word with you . Aye . Will you hold him for a minute ? Are you sure you 're not bringing a curse on this house taking him in like that ? -He 's such a strange young man . -Aye , but I 've just got a feeling about him . Looking after him is the right thing to do . That 's important . Hey , buddy . Look how the baby takes to him . Little Will never takes to strangers . It 's almost as if he 's connected to us . Hey , Will . So you 're my great-grandfather . The first McFly born in America . And you peed on me . Give us some soap . Here you go . Take a look and see what just breezed in the door . I did n't know the circus was in town . Must have got that shirt off a dead Chinese . What will it be , stranger ? I 'll have ... .. ice water . Ice water ? Water ? You want water , you better dunk your head in the horse trough out there . In here , we pour whiskey . -Excuse me . -For what ? I 'm trying to find a blacksmith . Hey , McFly ! Thought I told you never to come in ... You ai n't Seamus McFly . You look like him , though , especially with that dog-ugly hat . You kin to that hay barber ? -What 's your name , dude ? -Marty ... Eastwood . Clint Eastwood . -What kind of stupid name is that ? -He 's the runt of the litter . Boys , would you look-see at these pearly whites ? I ai n't seen teeth that straight that were n't store-bought . Take a gander at them moccasins . What kind of skins is them ? What 's that writing mean ? `` Nike '' ? Is that Indian talk ? Bartender , I 'm looking for that no-good , cheating blacksmith . -You seen him ? -No , sir , Mr. Tannen . I have not . Tannen . You 're Mad Dog Tannen . `` Mad Dog '' ? I hate that name . I hate it , you hear ? Nobody calls me `` Mad Dog '' ! Especially not some duded-up , egg-sucking gutter trash . Dance ! Come on ! Come on , runt ! You can dance better than that ! Shit . -You better run , squirrel . -Get him ! We got ourselves a new courthouse . It 's high time we had a hanging ! Look at him sway . Yeah , have n't had a hanging in a long time ! I shoot the fleas off a dog 's back at 500 yards , Tannen ... ... and it 's pointed at your head ! You owe me money , blacksmith . How do you figure ? My horse threw a shoe . You done the shoeing , so that makes you responsible . Since you never paid me for the job , I 'd say that makes us even . Wrong ! I was on my horse when it happened , and I got throwed off ! That caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky redeye . The way I figure it , blacksmith , you owe me $ 5 for the whiskey ... ... and $ 75 for the horse ! That 's the $ 80 . If your horse threw a shoe , bring him back and I 'll reshoe him . I shot that horse ! -That 's your problem , Tannen . -Wrong . That 's yours . From now on , you better be looking behind you when you walk . Because one day you 're gon na get a bullet in your back . Doc ! Marty , I gave you explicit instructions not to come here ... ... but to go directly back to 1985 . I know , but I had to come . It 's good to see you , Marty . You 've got to do something about those clothes . -Dressed like that , you 're liable to get shot . -Or hanged . What idiot dressed you in that outfit ? You did . `` Shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of $ 80 '' ? `` September 7 '' ? That 's this Monday ! Now I wish I 'd paid him off . Who 's this `` beloved Clara '' ? I do n't know anyone named Clara . I do n't know , Doc . I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours . My involvement in such a social relationship ... ... here in 1885 ... ... could result in a disruption of the space-time continuum . As a scientist ... ... I can never take that risk . Certainly not after what we 've already been through . Emmett ! Hello , Emmett . Hubert . It 's the mayor . Excuse me , Emmett . Do you remember last week when you volunteered ... ... to meet the new schoolteacher at the station ? Yes , quite so . We just got word she 's coming in tomorrow . Here are the details for you . Thanks for all your help . Anytime , Hubert . Oh ! Her name 's Miss Clara Clayton . Well , Doc ... ... now we know who Clara is . Marty , it 's impossible . The idea that I could fall in love at first sight is romantic nonsense . There 's no scientific rationale for that concept . It 's not science . You meet the right girl , it hits you like lightning . Please , do n't say that . That 's the way it was for me and Jennifer . We could n't keep our eyes off each other . God , Jennifer , I hope she 's all right . I ca n't believe we just left her on the porch . Do n't worry . She 'll be fine . When you burned the almanac in 1955 , the normal timeline was restored . Once we 're back in 1985 ... ... you just have to go to her house to wake her up . Turn that valve over there , all the way to the right . Yeah , pull it all the way around . Let 's go ! Ice tea ? No , thanks . It 's a refrigerator . I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation . If I never meet her , there 's no possibility of a romantic infatuation . -You 're the doc . -All right . We 'll get the DeLorean and get back to the future . I tore a hole in the gas tank when I was landing ... ... so we 'll have to patch it up and get some gas . You mean , we 're out of gas ? Yeah . It 's no big deal . We 've got Mr. Fusion , right ? Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits and the flux capacitor . But the internal combustion engine runs on ordinary gasoline . It always has . There wo n't be a gas station around here until sometime in the next century . Without gasoline , we ca n't get the DeLorean up to 88 mph . So what do we do ? -Twenty-four ! -It 's no use , Marty ! Even the fastest horse in the world wo n't run more than 35 , 40 miles an hour ! Bartender said that 's the strongest stuff they got . Try it , Marty . Give it more gas ! Damn ! It blew the fuel injection manifold . Strong stuff , all right . It will take me a month to rebuild it . A month ? -You 're gon na get shot on Monday ! -I know ! I wish ... Wait . I 've got it ! We can roll it down a steep hill ! We 'll never find a smooth enough surface . Unless ... Of course ! Ice ! We 'll wait until winter when the lake freezes over . Winter ? What are you saying ? Monday is three days away ! All right . Let 's just think this thing through logically . We know it wo n't run under its own power . We know we ca n't pull it . But if we could figure out a way ... ... to push it up to 88 miles an hour ... That 's it . How fast can she go ? Why , I 've had her up to 55 myself . I heard that Fearless Frank Fargo got one of these up to near 70 ... ... out past Verde Junction . Do you think it 's possible to get it up to 90 ? Ninety ? Tarnation . Who would ever need to be in such a hurry ? Just a little bet he and I have , that 's all . Theoretically speaking , could it be done ? I suppose , if you had a straight stretch of track with a level grade ... ... and you were n't hauling no cars ... ... and if you could get the fire hot enough . I 'm talking about hotter than the blazes of Hell itself . It might be possible to get her up that fast . When does the next train come through ? Monday morning at 8:00 . Here . This spur that runs off the main line 3 miles out to Clayton Ravine . It 's a long stretch of level track that will still exist in 1985 . This is where we 'll push the DeLorean with the locomotive . Funny . This map calls Clayton Ravine '' Shonash Ravine . '' That must be the old Indian name for it . It 's perfect . A long run that goes across the bridge over the ravine ... ... over near that Hilldale housing development . Right , but according to this map ... ... there is no bridge . Well , Doc , we can scratch that idea . We ca n't wait for this thing to get finished . Marty , it 's perfect . You 're not thinking fourth dimensionally . Right . I have a problem with that . Do n't you see ? The bridge will exist in 1985 . It 's safe and still in use . As long as we get the DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour ... ... before we hit the edge of the ravine ... ... we 'll instantaneously arrive at a point in time where the bridge is completed . We 'll have track under us and coast safely across the ravine . What about the train ? It will be a spectacular wreck . Too bad no one will be around to see it . Help me ! Great Scott ! Hurry ! Jump ! Thank you , sir . You saved my ... ... life . Emmett Brown at your service , Miss ... Clayton . Clara Clayton . Clara ? What a beautiful name . May I help you inside with these ? That wo n't be necessary . I can take care of it . -You 've done more than enough already . -But it 's really no trouble . She says it 's fine , and we have to get going . Ma'am , good luck with your school teaching and everything . Clara . I 'll straighten everything out for the buckboard rental . Do n't worry about that . I feel somewhat responsible for what happened . That would be very gentlemanly of you , Mr. Brown . Emmett . You know , I 'm almost glad that snake spooked those horses . Otherwise , we might never have met . I suppose it was destiny . Thank you for everything . You 're quite welcome . I will see you again , wo n't I ? Of course . You 'll see lots of me . I have a shop in town . I 'm the local scientist , I mean , blacksmith . What sort of science ? Astronomy ? Chemistry ? Actually , I 'm a student of all sciences . Doc , we have to get going . Yes . Excuse us , Clara . We have to get going . Toodle-oo . What do you mean , you 'll be seeing lots of her ? I might see her again just in passing . Did you see the way she was looking at you ? She did have quite a scare , right ? Miss Clayton almost ended up at the bottom of Clayton Ravine . Holy shit . Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher . -They say she fell in there 100 years ago . -100 years ago ! -That 's this year ! -Every kid knows that story . We all have teachers we 'd like to see fall into the ravine . Great Scott ! Then she was supposed to go over in that wagon . Now I may have seriously altered history . Look , Doc , what 's the worse that can happen ? So they do n't name the ravine after her . Let 's get the DeLorean ready and get out of here . I wish I 'd never invented that infernal time machine . It 's caused nothing but disaster . Doc , this is Marty . Do you read me ? Over . Check , Marty . Great . These things still work . All right . Once more , let 's go over the entire plan and layout . -I apologize for the crudity of this model ... -Yeah , it 's not to scale . It 's okay . All right . Tomorrow night , Sunday ... ... we load the DeLorean onto the tracks here , on the spur ... ... by the abandoned silver mine . The switch track is where the spur runs off the main line ... ... three miles out to Clayton ... Shonash Ravine . The train leaves the station at 8:00 Monday morning . We 'll stop it , uncouple the cars , throw the switch track and then hijack ... ... borrow the locomotive and use it to push the time machine . According to my calculations we 'll reach ... the edge of the ravine , at which point we 'll be transported back to 1985 ... ... and coast safely across the completed bridge . What does this mean ? `` Point of no return . '' That 's our fail-safe point . Till there , we have time to stop the locomotive before it plunges into the ravine . But once we pass this windmill , it 's the future or bust . Here you go . Connect that to the positive terminal . All right , you all set ? Yeah . Go ! Train pulling out of the station ! Coming up to the switch track ! Stop at the switch track ! Throw the switch ! Pull up to the DeLorean ! Pushing the DeLorean ... ... up to 88 miles per hour ! It could n't be simpler . Emmett ? It 's Clara . Quick , cover the DeLorean ! Hello . Why , hello . This is quite a surprise . I hope I 'm not disturbing anything . We were just doing a little model railroading . When my bags were thrown from the wagon ... ... my telescope was damaged . Since you mentioned an interest in science ... ... I thought you might be able to repair it for me . I would pay you , of course . I would n't think of charging you for this . Let 's have a look at it . I think a lens may be out of alignment because ... ... if you move it this way the image turns fuzzy . See ? But if you turn it the other way ... ... then ... Everything becomes ... ... clear . I could repair it right away and have it for you tonight . Tonight is the town festival . I would n't dream of having you work on my telescope during such an occasion . You are planning on attending , are n't you ? -Actually , ma'am ... -Yes , of course . The festival . In that case , I 'll see you this evening at the festival . Mr. Eastwood . Ma'am . Thank you for taking care of my telescope . You 're quite welcome . It 's a nice telescope . Ladies and gentlemen ... ... as mayor of Hill Valley ... ... it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this clock ... ... to the people of Hill County ! May it stand for all time ! Tell me when , gentlemen . Three ! Two ! One ! Now ! Let the festivities begin ! In a way , it 's fitting that you and I are here to witness this . It 's too bad I did n't bring my camera . Ready , gentlemen ? The only problem is , we 'll never be able to show it to anybody . Smile , Doc . What great music ! Yeah , it 's got a beat , and you can dance to it . Step right up and test your mettle with the latest products ... ... from Col. Samuel Colt 's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company ... ... of Hartford , Connecticut . Now , take this model , for example . The new , improved and refined Colt Peacemaker ... ... selling to you tonight for the low price of $ 12 . -Good evening . -'Evening . You look very nice . Thank you . Would you like ... -Would you care to ... -I 'd love to . Young man , you want to give it a try ? No , thanks . Doc , this ... Son ! -Sonny boy ! -Doc can dance ? Son . I just told you that even a baby could handle this weapon . Surely you 're not afraid to try . I 'm not afraid of nothing . Come on , then . Just step up here like a man . Now , young man , what you do is just ease that hammer back and ... ... squeeze off a round . Right on out there and be real smooth . That 's the way you do it . -Can I try that again ? -Yeah , go ahead . Tell me one thing . Where did you learn to shoot like that ? Buford , you sure that blacksmith will be at this shindig ? Sure he 's here . Everybody 's here tonight . You 'll have to check your firearms if you want to join in on the festivities . Who 's gon na make us , tenderfoot ? I am . Marshal Strickland . I did n't know you was back in town . If you ca n't read the sign , I presume you can read this . Pretty tough hombre when you 're pointing a gun at a man 's back . Just like you , I take every advantage I can get . You gon na check your iron ? I was just joking with your deputy . Of course , I 'm gon na check my iron . We all were , were n't we , boys ? Yeah , right . Tannen . Your knife , too . Smile , Marshal . After all , this is a party . Only party I 'll be smiling at ... ... is the one that sees you at the end of a rope . Have fun ! That 's how you handle them . Never give them an inch ... ... and maintain discipline at all times . Remember that word : discipline . I will , Pa . Thank you very much . Mr. Eastwood , nice to see you . I see you got yourself some respectable clothes and a fine hat . A couple people did n't like the way the other one looked on me . That one suits you . -It 's very becoming . -Thanks . `` Frisbee . '' Far out . -What was the meaning of that ? -It was right in front of him . -That 's mine ! -Not anymore . -Give me that . -There he is , Buford . -Where ? -There . Dancing with that piece of calico . What are you gon na do , boss ? I figure if I bury this muzzle deep enough in his back nobody will hear the shot . Careful . You 've only got one bullet with that . I only need one . I told you to watch your back , smithy . You 're early . It 's a Derringer . Small but effective . The last time I used it , fella took two days to die . Bled to death inside . It was real painful . That means you 'll be dead by about supper time Monday . Excuse me . I do n't know who you think you are , but we 're dancing . Look what we have here . Ai n't you gon na introduce me ? I 'd like a dance . I would n't give you the pleasure . You 'll have to go ahead and shoot . -All right . -I 'll dance with him . Boys , keep the blacksmith company while I get acquainted with the filly ! Yeah ! I do n't dance very well when my partner has a gun in his hand . You 'll learn . Maybe I 'll just take my $ 80 worth out of her ! Leave her alone ! Yeah , I bet there 's something you can do that 's worth $ 80 . I believe you 've underestimated me , mister . Have I ? Stop it ! Damn you ! No , I damn you ! I damn you to hell ! -You . -Lighten up , jerk ! Mighty strong words , runt ! You man enough to back them up with more than just a pie plate ? Just leave my friends alone . What 's wrong , dude ? You yellow ? That 's what I thought . A yellow-belly . Nobody calls me yellow . Then let 's finish it . Right now . Not now , Buford . Marshal 's got our guns . Like I said , we 'll finish this tomorrow ! Tomorrow we 're robbing the Pine City stage . What about Monday ? We doing anything Monday ? Monday would be fine . You can kill him on Monday . I 'll be back this way on Monday . We 'll settle this then . Right there , out in the street ... ... in front of the Palace Saloon . Yeah , right . When ? High noon ? Noon ? I do my killing before breakfast . 7:00 ! Marty ! Break it up . What 's all this about ? You causing trouble here , Tannen ? No trouble , Marshal . Just a little personal matter between me and Eastwood . This do n't concern the law . Tonight , everything concerns the law . Break it up . Any brawling , it 's 15 days in the county jail . All right , folks . This is a party . Come on ! Let 's have some fun ! If you ai n't here , I 'll hunt you and shoot you down like a duck . It 's `` dog . '' Shoot him down like a dog . Let 's go , boys ! Let these sissies have their party ! What are you doing , saying you 'll meet Tannen ? Do n't worry about it . Monday morning we 'll be gone . Theoretically , yes . But what if the train 's late ? -We 'll discuss this later . -We 'll discuss it now . -Thank you for your gallantry . -Ma'am . Had you not interceded , Emmett might have been shot . Marty ... Clint , I 'm gon na take Clara home . -Right . Good night . -You sure set him straight . I 'm glad somebody finally stood up to that son of a bitch . You 're all right in my book . I 'd like to buy you a drink . You do n't have to buy me anything . It was no big deal ... You can have this brand-new Colt Peacemaker and gun belt , free of charge . Free ? I want everybody to know the gun that shot Buford Tannen ... ... was a Colt Peacemaker ! No problem . Thanks a lot . Of course , if you lose , I 'm taking it back . Thanks again . You had him . You could have walked away and nobody would have thought less of you . All it would have been was words , hot air from a buffoon . Instead , you let him rile you ... ... into playing his game , his way , by his rules . Seamus , relax . I know what I 'm doing . -He reminds me of poor Martin . -Aye . -Who ? -Me brother . Wait a minute . You have a brother named Martin McFly ? Had a brother . Martin used to let men provoke him into fighting . He was concerned people would think him a coward if he refused . That 's how he got a knife shoved through his belly in a saloon in Virginia City . Never considered the future , poor Martin . God rest his soul . Sure , and I hope you're considering the future , Mr. Eastwood . I think about it all the time . That crater all by itself , like a starburst . Yeah . That one 's called Copernicus . Listen to me . I feel like I 'm teaching school . Please , continue the lesson . I never found lunar geography so fascinating . You 're quite knowledgeable . When I was 11 , I had diphtheria . I was quarantined for three months . My father brought this telescope and put it next to my bed ... ... so I could see everything out the window . Do you think we 'll ever travel to the moon ... ... the way we travel across the country on trains ? Definitely . Although not for 84 years , and not on trains . We 'll have space capsules sent aloft with rockets ... ... devices that create giant explosions so powerful they just ... That they break the pull of gravity and send the projectile to outer space . Emmett ! I read that book , too ! You 're quoting Jules Verne , From the Earth to the Moon . You 've read Jules Verne ? -I adore Jules Verne . -So do I . My absolute favorite . The first time I read that as a little boy , I wanted to meet Captain Nemo . Do n't tease . You could n't have read that when you were a boy . It was only first published 10 years ago . Yes . I meant it made me feel like a boy . I never met a woman who liked Jules Verne before . I never ever met a man like you before . Doc ? Doc ? Hope you know what you 're doing . You talking to me ? You talking to me , Tannen ? I 'm the only one here . Go ahead ! Make my day . Good morning . 'Morning . Have a cigar . Anything I can do for you today ? -No , that 's fine . -Good luck tomorrow . -We 'll be praying for you . -Thanks . Good morning . Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow ? I 'm fine . Thanks . What are you doing ? Nothing . I was just out enjoying the morning air . It 's really lovely here in the morning . Do n't you think ? Yes . We 've got to load the DeLorean and get ready to roll . Look at that , the tombstone . Let me see that photograph again . My name , it 's vanished . That 's great , Doc . We 're going back to the future tomorrow , so everything 's being erased . But only my name is erased . The tombstone itself and the date still remain . That does n't make sense . We know this photograph represents what will happen ... ... if the events of today continue to run their course into tomorrow . -Right . So ? -Excuse me , Mr. Eastwood . -I just need to take your measurements . -Look , pal , I do n't want to buy a suit . -This is for your coffin . -My coffin ? The odds are running 2-1 against you . Might as well be prepared . So it may not be my name ... ... that 's going to be on this tombstone . It may be yours . -Great Scott . -I know , this is heavy . Why are you wearing that gun ? You're not considering going up against Tannen ? Tomorrow morning I 'm going back to the future with you . But if Buford Tannen comes looking for trouble , I 'll be ready for him . You heard what that son of a bitch called me . You ca n't lose your judgment over names . That 's exactly what causes you to get in that accident in the future . What ? What about my future ? I ca n't tell you . It might make things worse . Wait a minute . What is wrong with my future ? We all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives . You 've got to do what you 've got to do ... ... and I 've got to do what I 've got to do . -Marty . -Yeah ? I 've made a decision . I 'm not going with you tomorrow . I 'm staying here . What are you talking about ? There 's no point in denying it . -I 'm in love with Clara . -Oh , man . We do n't belong here . Neither one of us . It could still be you that gets shot tomorrow . This tombstone could still be in your future . Marty , the future is n't written . It can be changed . You know that . Anyone can make their future whatever they want it to be . I ca n't let this one little photograph determine my entire destiny . I have to live my life according to what I believe is right ... ... in my heart . Doc , you 're a scientist . So you tell me . What 's the right thing to do , up here ? You 're right , Marty . -That worked great . -I 've at least got to tell her good-bye . Come on , Doc . Think about it . What will you say to her ? `` I 've got to go back to the future '' ? She wo n't understand that . Hell , I 'm in it with you , and I do n't even understand it . Doc . Listen . Maybe we ... Maybe we can just take Clara with us . To the future ? As you reminded me , I 'm a scientist , so I must be scientific about this . I cautioned you about disrupting the continuum for your own benefit . Therefore , I must do no less . We shall proceed as planned , and as soon as we return to 1985 ... ... we 'll destroy this infernal machine . Traveling through time has become much too painful . It 's Emmett , Clara . Emmett , wo n't you come in ? No , I better not . I ... What 's wrong ? I 've come to say good-bye . Good-bye ? Where are you going ? I 'm going away . I 'm afraid I 'll never see you again . Emmett . Clara , I want you to know that I care about you deeply . But I 've realized that I do n't belong here , and I have to go back where I came from . Where might that be ? I ca n't tell you . Then wherever you 're going , take me with you . I ca n't , Clara . I wish it did n't have to be this way ... ... but believe me when I tell you that I 'll never forget you ... ... and that I love you . I do n't understand what you 're trying to say . Clara . I do n't think there 's any way that you can understand it . Please , I have to know . If you sincerely do love me , then tell me the truth . All right then . I 'm from the future . I came here in a time machine that I invented ... ... and tomorrow I have to go back to the year 1985 . Yes , Emmett . I do understand . I understand that because you know I 'm partial to the writings of Jules Verne ... ... you concocted those mendacities in order to take advantage of me . I 've heard some whoppers in my day ... ... but the fact that you 'd expect me to believe this ... ... is so insulting and degrading ! All you had to say is , `` I do n't love you and I do n't want to see you anymore . '' That , at least , would have been respectful ! But that 's not the truth . Good to see you , too . Emmett . What can I get you , the usual ? No , Chester , I 'll need something a lot stronger than that tonight . -Sarsaparilla . -Whiskey , Chester . Whiskey ? Are you sure ? You know what happened to you on the Fourth of July . Whiskey . Okay , I ai n't your papa . Just do n't want to see you do the wrong thing . You can leave the bottle . It 's a woman , right ? I knew it . I 've seen that look on a man 's face ... ... a thousand times all across the country . All I can tell you , friend , is you 'll get over her . Clara was one in a million . One in a billion . One in a googolplex . The woman of my dreams , and I 've lost her for all time . I can assure you , sir , there are other women . Peddling this barbed wire across the country ... ... has taught me one thing for certain ... ... it 's that you never know what the future might bring . The future . I can tell you about the future . Man , did I sleep . What time is it , Doc ? Doc ! Wake up ! Get up ! Let 's go ! I got me a runt to kill . It 's still early , boss . What 's your hurry ? I 'm hungry . And in the future , we do n't need horses . We have motorized carriages called automobiles . If everybody 's got one of these auto whatsits ... ... does anybody walk or run anymore ? Of course they run , but for recreation , for fun . Run for fun ? What the hell kind of fun is that ? Doc ! How much has he had ? None . That 's the first one , and he has n't touched it yet . He just likes to hold it . Doc ! What are you doing ? I 've lost her , Marty . There 's nothing left for me here . That 's why you got ta come back with me . -Where ? -Back to the future ! -Right ! Let 's get going ! -Great . Gentlemen , excuse me . My friend and I have to catch a train . Here 's to you , blacksmith . -And to the future . -Amen . -Amen . -Emmett , no ! Doc ! Come on , Doc . Wake up ! Wake up , Doc ! -How many did he have ? -Just the one . -Just the one ? Come on , Doc . -There 's a fellow that ca n't hold his liquor . -Get me some black coffee ! -Joey , coffee ! Ma'am ? -How far does the 8:00 train go ? -San Francisco is the end of the line . I 'll take a one-way ticket . To sober him up in a hurry , you need something a lot stronger than coffee . What do you suggest ? Joey , let 's make some wake-up juice . Come on , Doc , swallow . In about 10 minutes ... ... he 's gon na be as sober as a priest on Sunday . Ten minutes ! Why do we cut these things so damn close ? Here , stick this clothespin on his nose . When he opens up his mouth , go ahead and pour it on down his gullet . Stand back . -He 's still out ! -That was just a reflex action . It 'll take a few more minutes for the stuff to clear up his head . Perfect . Come on , Doc . Wake up , buddy . Wake up , Doc ! Seamus ? Would n't expect to see you here this morning . Aye . Something inside me told me I should be here ... ... as if my future had something to do with it . He 'll come around in a minute . Come on . Come on , Doc . Let 's go ! Let 's wake up now , buddy . Are you in there , Eastwood ? It 's 8:00 and I 'm calling you out . It 's not 8:00 yet ! It is by my watch ! Let 's settle this once and for all , runt ! Or ai n't you got the gumption ? Listen . I 'm not really feeling up to this today . -So I 'll have to forfeit . -Forfeit ? What 's that mean ? -It means that you win without a fight . -Without shooting ? He ca n't do that . You ca n't do that ! You know what I think ? I think you ai n't nothing but a gutless , yellow turd ! I 'm giving you to the count of 10 to come out here and prove I 'm wrong ! One ! Doc , come on , sober up , buddy . Two ! You better get out there , son . I got $ 20 gold bet on you , so do n't let me down . Three ! I got $ 30 gold bet against you , so do n't let me down . Four ! You better face up to it , son , because if you do n't go out there ... What ? Five ! -What if I do n't go out there ? -You 're a coward . Six ! And you 'll be branded a coward for the rest of your days ! Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood ... ... is the biggest yellow-belly in the West ! Seven ! Here ! Eight ! I already got a gun . Nine ! Ten ! Do you hear me , runt ? I said that 's 10 , you gutless , yellow pie-slinger ! He 's an asshole ! I do n't care what Tannen says ! I do n't care what anybody else says either . Doc , you okay ? I think so . What a headache ! -You got a back door to this place ? -It 's in the back . Let 's go . Are you coming out here or do I have to come in after you ? The thing I really miss here is Tylenol . Hey ! Reach , blacksmith ! Yes , sir , that poor fellow last night ... ... had the worst case of broken heart I have ever seen . When he said he did n't know how he could live the rest of his life ... ... knowing how much hurt he 'd caused that little girl ... ... I really felt for him , I did , right here . Listen up , Eastwood ! I aim to shoot somebody today , and I prefer it 'd be you . But if you 're just too damn yellow ... ... it 'll just have to be your blacksmith friend . Forget about me , Marty , and save yourself ! You got one minute to decide . You hear me , runt ? One minute ! I 've never seen a man so broken up over a woman : What did he say her name was ? Cara ? Sara ? -Clara . -Clara . -Excuse me . -Ma'am ? Was this man tall , with great big brown puppy-dog eyes ... ... and long silvery , flowing hair ? You know him . Emmett ! Time 's up , runt ! Prepare to meet your maker , blacksmith . Right here , Tannen ! Draw ! No ! I thought we could settle this like men . You thought wrong , dude . Thank you . That was good . You know what I think ? -I think Buford 's going to jail . -Yeah . Get him out of that shit . Get them ! Buford Tannen , you 're under arrest for robbing the Pine City stage . You got anything to say ? I hate manure . Look ! Yes ! -The train ! -Can we make it ? We 'll have to cut them off at Coyote Pass . Hey , mister . Mr. Eastwood . -Here 's your gun , mister . -Thanks , kid . Seamus . It 's worth $ 12 . Never been used . Maybe I 'll trade it for a new hat . Right ! Take care of that baby ! I will ! Emmett ! Emmett ! Emmett ! `` Time machine . '' Come on ! Go ! Give me your hand ! Come on ! Come on , Marty . Come on . Let 's go ! Masks on . Reach ! Is this a holdup ? It 's a science experiment . Stop the train just before you hit the switch track up ahead . Doc ! Uncouple the cars from the tender ! I 've wanted to do that all my life . What are these things ? My version of Presto Logs . Compressed wood with anthracite dust ... ... chemically treated to burn hotter and longer . I use them so I do n't have to stoke my forge . These three will ignite sequentially ... ... make the fire hotter , kick up the boiler pressure ... ... and make the train go faster . Ready to roll ! Emmett ! Marty , are the time circuits on ? Check ! Input the destination time : October 27 , 1985 , 11:00 a.m . Check . We 're cruising at a steady 25 miles an hour . I 'm throwing in the Presto Logs . The new dashboard gauge will tell us the boiler temperature . It 's color-coded to indicate when each log will fire . Green , yellow and red . Each detonation will be accompanied by a sudden burst of acceleration . Hopefully we 'll hit 88 miles per hour before the needle gets much past 2,000 . Why ? What happens after it hits 2,000 ? The whole boiler explodes ! Perfect ! We just hit 35 ! Okay , Marty . I 'm coming aboard ! Emmett ! Come on . You better hold onto something ! The yellow log is about to blow ! Golly . We just passed 40 ! Emmett ! We just passed 45 ! Go for it ! Fifty . Emmett ! Clara ! I love you ! What 's happening ? It 's Clara ! She 's on the train ! Clara ? Perfect . She 's in the cab ! I 'm going back for her ! The windmill ! Doc ! We 're going past 50 ! You 'll never make it ! Then we 'll have to take her back with us ! Keep calling out the speed ! Clara , climb out here to me ! -I do n't know if I can ! -You can do it ! Just do n't look down ! That 's it ! Sixty miles an hour ! You 're doing fine ! Nice and steady ! Come on ! -Just a little further ! -I ca n't ! I 'm scared ! Seventy ! Keep coming , Clara ! Come on ! You 're doing fine ! Come on ! Nice and easy ! Do n't look down ! That 's it ! You 're doing fine ! The red log is about to blow ! Clara ! Emmett ! I 'm trying to reach you ! Clara , hold on ! I ca n't ! I 'll slip you the Hoverboard ! Marty , watch out ! Emmett , help ! Hold on ! Ready , Doc ? Catch it ! Yes ! Emmett ! Clara ! Well , Doc ... ... it 's destroyed . Just like you wanted . -Hey , butthead , get away ... -Watch it , Biff ! I did n't mean to scare you . I did n't recognize you . -What the hell are you doing ? -Just putting on the second coat . You going cowboy ? Come on , guys . We 'll be late for brunch . Dad , they wo n't hold your reservations all day . I ca n't find my glasses . -Have you seen them ? -They 're in your suede jacket . Marty ? What 's wrong ? We thought you went to the lake . -You wore that to the lake ? -Thank God you guys are back to normal . Who are you supposed to be ? Clint Eastwood ? Right . I have to go get Jennifer . -I really like that hat . -Thanks , Biff . Jennifer . Jen . Jennifer . Marty . Marty ! I had the worst nightmare . That dream I had is so real . It was about the future . About us . And you got fired . Wait a minute . What do you mean , I got fired ? Hilldale . Hilldale ! This is where we live . I mean , this is where we 're going to live . Someday . It was a dream , was n't it ? The big M. -How 's it hanging , McFly ? -Hey , Needles . Nice set of wheels . Let 's see what she can do . Next green light . No , thanks . What 's the matter ? Chicken ? -Marty , do n't . -Grab hold of something . -Come on ! -Get on ! Yeah , go ! Did you do that on purpose ? Yeah . You think I 'm stupid enough to race that asshole ? Jeez ! I would have hit that Rolls-Royce . It erased . You 're right . There 's not much left . Doc 's never coming back . I 'll sure miss him , Jen . What the hell ? -Doc ! -Marty ! -Doc ! -Marty ! It runs on steam ! Meet the family . Clara , you know . -Hi , Marty ! -Ma'am ! These are our boys : Jules and Verne . Boys , this is Marty and Jennifer . -Doc , I thought I 'd never see you again . -You ca n't keep a good scientist down . I had to come back for Einstein ... ... and I did n't want you to be worried about me . I brought you a little souvenir . It 's great , Doc . Thanks . Dr. Brown , I brought this note back from the future ... ... and now it 's erased . Of course it 's erased . What does that mean ? It means your future has n't been written yet . No one 's has . Your future is whatever you make it . So make it a good one , both of you . We will , Doc ! Stand back ! All right , boys , buckle up ! Where are you going now ? Back to the future ? No . Already been there .

The reign of the ter- rible lizards had long since passed , but here on the continent which would one day be known as Africa , the battle for survival had reached a new climax of ferocity , and the victor was not yet in sight . In this dry and barren land , only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish , or even hope to exist . 10/13/65 a1 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A2 INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes , and they were on the long , pathetic road to racial extinction . About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small , parched valley , divided by a sluggish , brown stream . The tribe had always been hungry , and now it was starving . As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave , Moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night . He did not know the Old One was his father , for such a relationship was beyond his understanding . but as he stands looking down at the emac- iated body he feels something , something akin to sadness . Then he carries his dead father out of the cave , and leaves him for the hyenas . Among his kind , Moonwatcher is almost a giant . He is nearly five feet high , and though badly undernourished , weighs over a hundred pounds . His hairy , muscular body is quite man-like , and his head is already nearer man than ape . The forehead is low , and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets , yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity . As he looks out now upon the hostile world , there is already 10/13/65 a2 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A2 CONTINUED something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape . In those dark , deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima- tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years . 10/13/65 a3 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A3 EXT THE STREAM - THE OTHERS As the dawn sky brightens , Moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream . The Others are already there . They were there on the other side every day - that did not make it any less annoying . There are eighteen of them , and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of Moonwatcher 's own tribe . As they see him coming , the Others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream , and his own people reply In kind . The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun , and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water . Honor has been satisfied - each group has staked its claim to its own territory . 10/13/65 a4 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A4 EXT AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries , fruit and leaves , and fight off pangs of hunger , while all around them , competing with them for the samr fodder , is a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat . Yet all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach ; the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination . They are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty . 10/13/65 a5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A5 EXT PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION The tribe slowly wanders across the bare , flat country- side foraging for roots and occasional berries . Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain , about fifty feet apart . The ground is flat for miles around . Suddenly , Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion , stalking them about 300 yards away . Defenceless and with nowhere to hide , they scatter in all directions , but the lion brings one to the ground . 10/13/65 a6 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A6 EXT DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY It had not been a good day , though as Moonwatcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day with another . But on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree , and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people could ever know . Of course , he also collects a good many stings , but he scacely notices them . He is now as near to contentment as he is ever likely to be ; for thought he is still hungry , he is not actually weak with hunger . That was the most that any hominid could hope for . 10/13/65 a7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A7 INT & EXT CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS Over the valley , a full moon rises , and a cold wind blows down from the distant mountains . It would be very cold tonight - but cold , like hunger , was not a matter for any real concern ; it was merely part of the background of life . This Little Sun , that only shone at night and gave no warmth , was dangerous ; there would be enemies abroad . Moonwatcher crawls out of the cave , clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance , and squats there where he can survey the valley . If any hunting beast approached , he would have time to get back to the relative safety of the cave . Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth , Moonwatcher's race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon , and though he could not remember it , when he was young , Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face . Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high enough . He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of the lower caves , and he does not need to hear the 10/13/65 a8 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A7 CONTINUED occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening . Down there in the darkness , old One-Eye and his family are dying , and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses Moonwatcher 's mind . The harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies . Every cave is silent , lest it attract disaster . And in the caves , in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting , were gathered the nightmares of generations yet to come . 10/13/65 a9 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A8 EXT THE STREAM - INVASION The Others are growing desperate ; the forage on their side of the valley is almost exhausted . Perhaps they realise that Moonwatcher 's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the night , for they choose this mourning to break the truce . When they meet at the river in the still , misty dawn , there is a deeper and more menacing note in their challenge . The noisy but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds before the invasion begins . In an uncertainly-moving horde , the Others cross the river , shieking threats and hunched for the attack . They are led by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher 's own size and age . Startled and frightened , the tribe retreats before the first advance , throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations at the invaders . Moonwatcher moves with them , his mind a mist of rage and confusion . To be driven from their own territory is a great badness , but to lose the river is death . He does not know what to do ; it is a situation beyond his experience . Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing 10/13/65 a10 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A8 CONTINUED down , and advancing with obvious reluctance . The further they move from their own side , the more uncertain and unhappy they become . Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original drive , and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers . As he sees this , Moonwatcher 's own morale immediately revives . He slows down his retreat , and begins to make reassuring noises to his companions . Novel sensations fill his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and leadership . Before he realizes it , he is face to face with Big-Tooth , and the two tribes come to a halt many paces away . The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended quickly if either had used his fist as a club , but this innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the future . Instead , the slowly weakening fighters claw and scratch and try to bite each other . Rolling over and over , they come to a patch of stony ground , and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top . By chance , 10/13/65 a11 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A8 CONTINUED he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth 's scalp , and bang his head on the ground . The resulting CRACK is so satisfactory , and produces such an immediate weakening In Big - Tooth 's resistance , that he quickly repeats it . Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time , Moon- watcher keeps up the exhilirating game . With shrieks of panic , the Others retreat back , across the stream . The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as The water 's edge . 10/13/65 a12 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- EXT CAVE - NEW SOUND Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle , Moonwatcher is startled by a sound . He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave , straining his senses out into the night , and fear creeps slowly into his soul . Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this . The great cats approached in silence , and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth , or the occasional cracking of a twig . Yet this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder . It seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night , making no attempt at concealment , and ignoring all obstacles . And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not possibly have identified , for it had never been heard before in the history of this planet . 10/13/65 a13 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A10 EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning . He had almost forgotten the terror of the night , because nothing had happened after that initial noise , so he does not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear . There is nothing in the least alarming about it . It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side , and it is made of some completely transparent material ; indeed , it is not easy to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges . There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can compare this apparition . Though he is wisely cautious of most new things , he does not hesitate to walk up to it . As nothing happens , he puts out his hand , and feels a warm , hard surface . After several minutes of intense thought , he arrives at a brilliant explanation . It is a rock , of course , and it must have grown during the night . There are many plants that do this - white , pulpy things shaped like pebbles , that seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness . It is true that they are small and round , whereas this is large and square ; 10/13/65 a14 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A10 CONTINUED but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws . This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test . The white , round pebble-plants are very tasty ( though there were a few that made one violently sick ) ; perhaps this square one ... ? A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him . There is no nourishment here ; so like a sensible hominid , he continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube . 10/13/65 a15 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A11 EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the sound begins . It is quite soft , and it stops them in their tracks , so that they stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging . A simple , maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube and hypnotises all who come within its spell . For the first time - and the last , for two million year - the sound of drumming is heard in Africa . The throbbing grows louder , more insistent . Presently the hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers , towards the source of that magnetic sound . Sometimes they take little dancing steps , as their blood responds to the rhythms that their descendants will not create for ages yet . Totally entranced , they gather around the Cube , forgetting the hardships of the day , the perils of the approaching dusk , and the hunger in their bellies . Now , spinning wheels of light begin to merge , and the spokes fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance , 10/13/65 a16 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A11 CONTINUED rotating on their axes as they do ; and the hominids watch , wide- eyed , mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube . Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears . It is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and shifted into the night . Inside that block is a group of four hominids , who might have been members of Moonwatcher's own tribe , eating chunks of meat . The carcass of a wart-hog lies near them . This little family of male and female and two children is gorged and replete , with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined . From time to time they stir lazily , as they loll at ease near the entrance of their cave , apparently at peace with the world . The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally different scene . The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave ; it is foraging , searching for food like any normal hominids . 10/13/65 a17 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A11 CONTINUED A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids without giving them more than a glance , for they had never been the slightest danger to its species . But that happy state of affairs is about to end . The big male suddenly bends down , picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet - and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig . The stone descends upon its skull , making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth . And the result , too , is much the same - the warthog gives one amazed , indignant squeal , and collapses in a motionless heap . Then the whole sequence begins again , but this time it unfolds itself with incredible slowness . Every detail of the movement can be followed ; the stone arches leisurely through the air , the pig crumples up and sinks to the ground . There the scene freezes for long moments , the slayer standing motionless above the slain , the first of all weapons in his hand . The scene suddenly fades out . The cube is no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness ; the hominids stir , as if 10/13/65 a18 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A11 CONTINUED awakening from a dream , realise where they are , and scuttle back to their caves . They have no concious memory of what they had seen ; but that night , as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair , his ears attuned to the noises of the world around him , Moonwatcher feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge to kill . He had taken his first step towards humanity . 10/13/65 a19 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A12 EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia Babies were born and sometimes lived ; feeble , toothless thirty- year-olds died ; the lion took its toll in the night ; the Others threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered . In the course of a single year , Moonwatcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition . They had become as plump as the family in the Cave , who no longer haunted their dreams . They had learned their lessons well ; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that the Cube had revealed to them . They were no longer half-numbed with starvation , and they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought . Their new way of life was casually accepted , and they did not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing outside their cave . But no Utopia is perfect , and this one had two blemishes . The first was the marauding lion , whose passion for hominids seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished . The second was the tribe across the river ; for 10/13/65 a20 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A12 CONTINUED somehow the Others had survived , and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation . 10/13/65 a21 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A13 EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact , Moon- watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two consecutive nights . On the third the lion comes , betraying his presences by a small pebble slide . When they can here the lion below , softly tearing at the meat , they strain themselves against the massive boulder . The sound of the lion stops ; he is listening . Again they silently heave against the enormous stone , exerting the final limits of their strength . The rock begin to tip to a new balance point . The lion twitches alert to this sound , but having no fear of these creatures , he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost him his life ; he goes back to his meal . The rock moves slowly over the ledge , picking up speed with amazing suddeness . It strikes a projection in the cliff about fifteen feet above the ground , which deflects its path outward . Just at this instant , the lion reacts instinctively and leaps away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the 10/13/65 a22 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A13 CONTINUED onrushing boulder . He has combined the errors of over- confidence and bad luck . The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave . They also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to see what was happening , and was apparently killed by a small rock torn loose by the boulder ; but this was a small price to pay for such a great victory . * * * * * * * * And then one night the crystal cube was gone , and not even Moonwatcher ever thought of it again . He was still wholly unaware of all that it had done . 10/13/65 a23 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A14 EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD From their side of the stream , in the never violated safety of their own territory , the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over- looking the stream , silhouetted against the dawn sky . The Others begin to scream their daily challenge . But today something is different , though the Others do not immediatly recognize this fact . Instead of joining the verbal onslaught , as they had always done , Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise , and begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness never befor seen . As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the morning mist , they become aware of the terrible strangness of this encounter , and their rage gradually subsides down to an uneasy silence . At the water 's edge , Moonwatcher and his band stop . They carry their bone clubs and bone knives . 10/13/65 a24 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A14 CONTINUED Led by One-ear , the Others half-heartly resume the battle- chant . But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts the sound from their throats , and strikes terror into their hearts . Moonwatcher , who had been partly concealed by two males who walked before him , thrusts his arm high into the air . In his hand he holds a stoud tree branch . Mounted atop the branch is the bloody head of the lion , its mouth jammed open with a stick , displaying its frightful fangs . The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power . Moonwatchers stands motionless , thrusting the lion 's head high . Then with majestic deliberation , still carrying his mangled standard above his head , he begins to cross the stream , followed by his band . The Others fade back from the stream , seeming to lack even the ability to flee . Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear , who stands 10/13/65 a25 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A14 CONTINUED unsurely in front of his band . Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water 's edge , One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first displayed his fighting rage ; and he had never before been attacked with a weapon . One-Ear , merely looks up at the raised club until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down around him . The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher 's power . Moonwatcher surveys the scene . Now he was master of the world , and he was not sure what to do next . But he would think of something . 10/13/65 a26 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A SECTION TIMING A1 00.30 A2 00.45 A3 01.30 A4 00.30 A5 01.00 A6 01.00 A7 01.00 A8 03.00 A9 00.45 A10 02.00 A11 04.00 A12 02.00 A13 02.30 A14 02.30 A SECTION TOTAL : @ 23 MIN . 00 SECS -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- TITLE PART II YEAR 2001 a26a -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B1 EARTH FROM 200 MILES UP NARRATOR By the year 2001 , overpopulation has B1a replaced the problem of starvation THOUSAND MEGATON but this was ominously offset by the NUCLEAR BOMB IN ORBIT absolute and utter perfection of the ABOVE THE EARTH , weapon .

SMYSLOV That 's right . FLOYD I see . ELENA Another thing , Heywood , two days ago , one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius . 12/7/65 b33 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B20 CONTINUED FLOYD How did they manage to do that without any communication ? ELENA Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal . FLOYD Well , that does sound very odd . SMYSLOV Yes , and I 'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it . Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S . convention . FLOYD Yes ... Well , I hope the crew got back safely . SMYSLOV Fortunately , they did . FLOYD Well , I 'm glad about that . 12/7/65 b33a -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B20 CONTINUED THE RUSSIANS EXCHANGE MORE GLANCES .

SMYSLOV Dr. Floyd , at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss , may I ask you a straightforward question ? FLOYD Certainly . SMYSLOV Quite frankly , we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius . Something , apperently , of an unknown origin . Is this , in fact , what has happened ? A LONG , AWKWARD PAUSE 12/7/65 b33b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B20 CONTINUED FLOYD I 'm sorry , Dr. Smyslov , but I 'm really not at liberty to discuss this . SMYSLOV This epidemic could easily spread to our base , Dr. Floyd . We should be given all the facts . LONG PAUSE FLOYD Dr. Smyslov ... I 'm not permitted to discuss this . ELENA Are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink ? FLOYD No , thank you ... and I'm afraid now I really must be going .

EARTH MUCH SMALLER THAN AS SEEN FROM SPACE STATION NARRATOR The Aries-IB has become the standard Space-Station-to-Lunar surface vehicle . It was powered by low-thrust plasma jets which would continue the mild acceler- ation for fifteen minutes . Then the ship would break the bonds of gravity and be a free and indepen- dent planet , circling the Sun in an orbit of its own . 10/4/65 b34 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B21a ARIES PASSENGER AREA .

CO-PILOT Well , I 've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic . PILOT I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later . CO-PILOT Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight . PILOT Yes , well , whatever it is , they're certainly not fooling around . This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week . CO-PILOT I was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .

PILOT There 's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest . FLOYD When do we arrive at Clavius ? PILOT We 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . Is there anything we can do for you ? FLOYD Oh , no , thank you . The two girls have taken wonderful care of me . I 'm just fine . 12/14/65 b38 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B24 CONTINUED PILOT Well , if there is anything that you wnat , just give a holler . FLOYD Thank you . PILOT Incidentally , Dr. Floyd , I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements ? FLOYD What do you mean ? PILOT Well ... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius . We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours . And then we 're going to back empty . FLOYD I see . PILOT I take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at Clavius ? 12/14/65 b39 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B24 CONTINUED FLOYD I 'm afraid that 's out of my depart- ment , Captain . PILOT Well , I 'll tell you why I ask . You see , I 've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I have n't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so , and with all these stories one hears , I 'm a little concerned about her . FLOYD I see . Well , I 'm sorry about that . I would n't think there 's any cause for alarm . PILOT Yes , well , I would n't have been too concerned about it , except I 've heard these stories about the epidemic and , as a matter of fact , I 've heard that ten people have died already . 12/14/65 b40 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B24 CONTINUED FLOYD I wish I could be more helpful , Captain , but as I 've said , I don't think there 's any cause for alarm . PILOT Well , fine . Thanks very much , anyway , and I hope you don't mind me asking ? FLOYD No , of course , Captain , I can understand your concern .

SEATED AROUND THE TABLE ARE TWENTY SENIOR BASE PERSONNEL . HALVORSEN Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd , a distinguished member of the National Council of Astronautics . He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us , and before the briefing he would like to say a few words . Dr. Floyd . POLITE APPLAUSE . FLOYD WALKS TO FRONT OF ROOM . FLOYD First of all , I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell , who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made , and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science . POLITE APPLAUSE . 11/25/65 b54 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B38 CONTINUED FLOYD ( cont 'd ) Mr. Halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter , and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the Base . I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle , many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on Earth . I can understand and sympathize with your negative views . I have been personally embarrassed by this cover story . But I fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and I hope you will . It should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning . 11/25/65 b55 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B38 CONTINUED FLOYD This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced . Are there any questions ? MICHAELS Dr. Floyd , how long do you think this can be kept under wraps ? FLOYD ( pleasantly ) I 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council . And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event . There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement . 11/25/65 b56 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B38 CONTINUED HALVORSEN We will , of course , cooperate in any way possible , Dr. Floyd . 11/25/65 b56a -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B39 SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OF MOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMING OVER SURFACE OF MOON . 10/5/65 b57 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B40 INSIDE ROCKET BUS , FLOYD , HALVORSEN , MICHAELS , FOURTH MAN , PILOT AND CO-PILOT .

MICHAELS Yes , it does . The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago . FLOYD How can you tell it was deliberately buried ? MICHAELS By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill . FLOYD Any clue as to what it is ? MICHAELS Not really . It 's completely inert . No sound or energy sources have been detected . The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we 've been barely able to scratch it .

FLOYD But you do n't have any idea as to what it is ? MICHAELS Tomb , shine , survey-marker spare part , take your choice . HALVORSEN The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth . SILENT APPRECIATION HALVORSEN Four million years ago , something , presumably from the stars , must have swept through the solar system and left this behind . 11/25/65 b64 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B44 CONTINUED FLOYD Was it abandoned , forgotten , left for a purpose ? HALVORSEN I suppose we 'll never know . MICHAELS The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys . SOME MORE SILENCE FLOYD Any ideas about the colour ? MICHAELS Well , not really . At first glance , black would suggest something sun-powered , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device ? FLOYD Has it been exposed to any sun before now ? MICHAELS I do n't think it has , but I'd like to check that .

NARRATOR A hundred million miles beyond Mars , in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled , Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids . NARRATOR Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond ; neutron and x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see ; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds , as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children . NARRATOR All these things and many others were patiently noted by Deep- Space-Monitor-79 , and recorded in its crystalline memory . 11/25/65 b68 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B47 CONTINUED NARRATOR But now it had noted something strange - the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system , and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past . NARRATOR It was also observed by Orbiter M-15 , circling Mars twice a day ; and High Inclination Probe- 21 , climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic ; and even artificial Comet-5 , heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto , along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years . NARRATOR All noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system , throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat . 11/25/65 b69 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- B SECTION TIMING B1-1f 00.50 B25 00.10 B2 00.10 B26 00.20 B3 00.15 B27 00.05 B4 00.15 B28 Out B5 00.20 B29 00.30 B6 00.15 B30 00.30 B7 00.10 B31 00.25 B8 00.15 B32 00.20 B9 00.10 B33 00.20 B10 00.10 B34 00.30 B11 00.15 B35 00.20 B12 00.50 B36 00.20 B13 01.10 B37 00.30 B14 00.35 B38 02.15 B15 Out B39 00.20 B16 Out B40 00.50 B17 01.15 B41 00.15 B18 00.15 B42 00.10 B19 01.00 B43 00.15 B20 03.55 B44 01.40 B21 00.20 B45 00.20 B21A 00.20 B46 00.40 B21B 00.15 B47 01.25 B22 01.00 B23 00.10 B24 01.30 B SECTION TOTAL : 28 MIN . 10 SECS . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- TITLE PART III 14 MONTHS LATER b69a -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C1 DISCOVERY 1,000,000 MILES FROM EARTH .

POOLE Well , it 's nothing really important , but it 's annoying . BOWMAN What 's up ? POOLE It 's about my salary cheques . BOWMAN Yes ? POOLE Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left . 12/14/65 c12 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Yes , I remember you mentioning it . I got mine about the same time . POOLE That 's right . Well , naturally , I did n't say anything to Payroll . I assumed they 'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque . But it 's been almost three weeks now and I 'm still being paid as an AGS-18 . BOWMAN Interesting that you mention it , because I 've got the same problem . POOLE Really . BOWMAN Yes . POOLE Yesterday , I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control , and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine , and apparently not yours either . 12/14/65 c13 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Did they have any explanation for this ? POOLE Not really . They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall , and that we 're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices . BOWMAN It 's possible . POOLE Well , what do you think we ought to do about it ? BOWMAN I do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . I 'm sure they'll straighten it out . POOLE I must say , I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training . BOWMAN No . I never did , either . 12/14/65 c14 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C12 CONTINUED POOLE We spent so little time with them , I have trouble keeping their names straight .

You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out . BOWMAN No , as a matter of fact , I did n't . POOLE Oh , well , apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we do n't know , and that 's why we were trained separately and that 's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard . 12/14/65 c15 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well , what is it ?

BOWMAN Of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now . POOLE How ? BOWMAN Just ask Hal . It 's conceivable they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from Hal .

We 'd like to know whether this is true . HAL I 'm sorry , Frank , but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know . BOWMAN He 's got a point . POOLE Okay , then how do we re-phrase the question ? 12/14/65 c15c -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Still , you really do n't believe it , do you ? POOLE Not really . Though , it is strange when you think about it . It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training . BOWMAN Yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us . POOLE I know . It would be almost inconceivable . BOWMAN But not completely inconceivable ? POOLE I suppose it is n't logically impossible . BOWMAN I guess it is n't . POOLE Still , all we have to do is ask Hal . 12/14/65 c15b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well , the only important aspect of the mission are : where are we going , what will we do when we get there , when are we coming back , and ... why are we going ? POOLE Right . Hal , tell me whether the following statements are true or false . HAL I will if I can , Frank . POOLE Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn . True or false ? HAL True . POOLE Our transit time is 257 days . Is that true ?

HAL That 's true POOLE There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program , and to further our general knowledge of the planets . Is that true ?

MISSION CONTROL I would n't worry too much about the computer . First of all , there is still a chance that he is right , despite your tests , and if it should happen again , we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails . If the computer should turn out to be wrong , the situation is still not alarming . The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers . It has almost always revolved around a single detail , such as the one you have described , and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer 's performance in other areas . No one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning .

We believe , under these circumstances , it would be advisable to disconnect the computer from all ship operations and continue the mission under Earth-based computer control . 12/1/65 c85 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C78 CONTINUED BOWMAN ( co n't ) We think the additional risk caused by the ship-to-earth time lag is preferable to having an unreliable on-board computer .

( pause ) And now Simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer . I 'll pu him on ... C148 CUT TO SIMONSON SIMONSON Hello , Dave . I think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the Hal 9000 computer . We believe it all started about two months ago when you and Frank interrogated the computer about the Mission . ( co n't ) 12/13/65 c119 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON ( co n't ) You may have forgotten it , but we 've been running through all the monitor tapes . Do you remember this ? POOLE 'S VOICE The purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets . Is this true ? HAL 'S VOICE That is true . SIMONSON Well , I 'm afaid Hal was lying . He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur- ity reasons which we 'll explain later . The true purpose of the Mission was to have been explained to you by Mission Commander Kaminsky , on his revival . Hal knew this and he knew the actual mission , but he could n't tell you the truth when you challenged him . Under orders ( co n't ) 12/13/65 c120 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON ( co n't ) from earth he was forced to lie . In everything except this he had the usual reinforced truth program- ming . We believe his truth programming and the instructions to lie , gradually resulted in an incompatible conflict , and facedc with this dilemman , he developed , for want of a better description , neurotic symptoms . It 's not difficult to suppose that these symptoms would centre on the communication link with Earth , for he may have blamed us for his incompatible program- ming . Following this lin of thought , we suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection . Since he became operational , he had never known unconsciousness . It must have seemed the equivalent to death . ( co n't ) 12/13/65 c121 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON ( co n't ) At this point , he , presumably , took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors . If I cane speak in human terms , I do n't think we can blame him too much . We have ordered him to disobey his conscience . Well , that 's it . It 's very speculative , but we think it is a possible explanation . Anyway , good luck on the rest of the Mission and I 'm giving you back to Bernard . C149 CUT TO MISSION CONTROL . MISSION CONTROL Hello , Dave . Now , I 'm going to play for you a pre-taped briefing which had been stored in Hal's memory and would have been played for you by Mission Com- mmander Kaminsky , when he , ( co n't ) 12/13/65 c122 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C149 CONTINUED MISSION CONTROL ( co n't ) had been revived . The briefing is by Doctor Heywood Floyd . Here it is ... 12/13/65 c123 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C150 FLOYD 'S RECORDED BRIEFING FLOYD Good day , gentlemen . When you see this briefing , I presume you will be nearing your destination , Saturn . I hope that you 've had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner . I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you . Thirteen months before the launch date of your Saturn mission , on April 12th , 2001 , the first evidence for intelligent life outside the Earth was discovered . It was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater Tycho . No news of this was ever announced , and the event had been kept secret since then , for reasons which I will later explain . Soon after it was uncovered , it emitted a powerful blast of ( co n't ) 12/13/65 c124 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C150 CONTINUED FLOYD ( co n't ) radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise . Luckily for those at the site , it proved harmless . Perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at Saturn . A lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was sun-triggered , as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun-powered device . Burying it could only shield it from the sun , since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable . We finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun- powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered , at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself . ( co n't ) 12/14/65 c125 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C150 CONTINUED FLOYD What is its purpose ? I wish we knew . The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago , when our ancestors were primative man-apes . We 've examined dozens of theories , but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm . What the purpose of the alarm is , why they wish to have the alarm , whether the alarm represents any danger to us ? These are questions no one can answer . The intentions of an alien world , at least four million years older than we are , can not be reliably predicted . In view of this , the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation . Discussion took place at the highest levels between govern- ( co n't ) 12/14/65 c126 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C150 CONTINUED FLOYD ( co n't ) ments , and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us , until we have evidence to the contrary . This is , of course , why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a need-to-know basis . And now I should like to show you a TV monitor tape of the actual signalling event . 12/14/65 c127 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- C151 WE SEE A REPLAY OF THE TMA-1 RADIO EMISSION , AS SEEN FROM A TV MONITOR ON THE SPOT .

THE INTENTION HERE IS TO PRESENT A BREATHTAKINGLY BEA- UTIFUL AND COMPREHEN- SIVE SENSE OF DIFFERENT EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL WORLDS . THE NARRATION WILL SUGGEST IMAGES AND SITUATIONS AS YOU READ IT . 12/9/65 d1 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR ( co n't ) Those who had begun the expri- ment so long ago had not been men . But when they looked out across the deeps of space , they felt awe and wonder - and loneliness . In their explorations , they encountered life in many forms , and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution . They saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night . And because , in all the galaxy , they had found nothing more precious than Mind , they encouraged its dawning every- where . The great Dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system , after a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years . 12/9/65 d2 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR ( co n't ) They swept past the frozen outer planets , paused briefly above the deserts of dying Mars and presently looked down on Earth . For years they studied , collected and catalogued . When they had learned all they could , they began to modify . They tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean , but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years . They were patient , but they were not yet immortal . There was much to do in this Universe of a hundred billion stars . So they set forth once more across the abyss , knowing that they would never come this way again . Nor was there any need . Their wonderful machines could be trusted to do the rest . ( co n't ) 12/9/65 d3 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR ( co n't ) On Earth , the glaciers came and went , while above them , the changeless Moon still carried its secret . With a yet slower rhythm than the Polar ice , the tide of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy . Strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell , and passed on their knowledge to their successors . Earth was not forgotten , but it was one of a million silent worlds , a few of which would ever speak . Then the first explorers of Earth , recognising the limitations of their minds and bodies , passed on their knowledge to the great machines they had created , and who now trnscended them in every way . ( co n't ) 12/9/65 d4 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR For a few thousand years , they shared their Universe with their machine children ; then , realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done , they passed into history without regret . Not one of them ever looked through his own eyes upon the planet Earth again . But even the age of the Machine Entities passed swiftly . In their ceaseless experimenting , they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself , and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light . They could become creatures of radiation , free at last from the tyranny of matter . Now , they were Lords of the galaxy , and beyond the reach of time . They could rove at will among the stars , and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space . 12/9/65 d5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR ( co n't ) But despite their God-like powers , they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so many generations ago . The companion of Saturn knew nothing of this , as it orbited in its no man 's land between Mimas and the outer edge of rings . It had only to remember and wait , and to look forever Sunward with its strange senses . For many weeks , it had watched the approaching ship . Its long- dead makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them . And it recognised what was climbing starward from the Sun . If it had been alive , it would have felt excitement , but such an emotion was irrelevant to its great powers .

It had waited four million years ; it was prepared to wait for eternity . Presently , it felt the gentle touch of radiations , trying to probe its secrets . Now , the ship was in orbit and it began to speak , with prime numbers from one to eleven , over and over again . Soon , these gave way to more complex signals at many frequen- cies , ultra-violet , infra-red , X-rays . The machine made no reply . It had nothing to say . Then it saw the first robot probe , which descended and hovered above the chasm .

The great machine knew that this tiny scout was reporting back to its parent ; but it was too simple , too primative a device to detect the forces that were gathering round it now . Then the pod came , carrying life . The great machine searched its memories . The logic circuits made their decision when the pod had fallen beyond the last faint glow of the reflected Saturnian light . In a moment of time , too short to be measured , space turned and twisted upon itself . 12/9/65 d8 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- END OF SCREENPLAY END OF FILE"

All around them are `` visual rhythms '' -lines in the sidewalk , the even placement of trees , the sunlight breaking through the branches above them -and somewhere unseen , the rhythmic pounding of an elevator train .

Leonard , `` guided '' by the cadence of his friend 's tapping , begins to write . ( o ( oo The teacher 's hand at the blackboard hesitates . Distracted by 4. the rhythmic noise , he traces it to the offender and silences him with a look . \ ' Without the rhythm , and without , apparently , inner natural Page 2/87 rhythms to replace it , Leonard 's hand begins dragging the pen across the paper , forming vague scrawl , each word less defined than the last , until they begin melding together into what resembles nothing so much as a child 's rendering of ocean waves .

The boy from the train begins tapping his pen again , and , `` guided '' again by the rhythm , Leonard is able to give definition to the `` ocean waves , '' to form recognizable letters.and words .

The form in the machine , at the top , reads — BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL / ADMISSIONS / CONSULTATION REQUEST / NEUROLOGY . Sayer types in a lower section headed — FINDINGS / DIAGNOSIS . He turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled-over in her wheelchair , one arm very close to the floor , the hand Page 9/87 clutching the glasses . She is not moving , but she has moved . That , or she is dead . Sayer rights her , takes the glasses from her hand and slips them back onto her face . He studies her for a moment , and for that moment remains as still , as entranced , as her . He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the floor . He waits . She does n't retrieve them . He picks them up and holds them out to her . She does n't move to take them .

Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at her . Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it . And stays there , stiff , still . Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman 's face is that of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card tricks . Dismissing the phenomenon —• DR. KAUFMAN Page 10/87 A reflex .

SIDNEY : Yes . REV.12/12/89 ( PINK ) Pg.l5 23.CONT , ( continuity only ) Sidney turns to a patient , an elderly woman in a wheelchair beside him . Her state resembles that of Lucy 's , that is , she appears to have no awareness of Sidney , Sayer , or anything else in her environment .

What 's unsettling about this one , apart from the man 's ghostlike appearance , is the angle of his wheelchair . It 's like an P~-\ askew painting , as if whoever was wheeling it simply let go of \TS ? the chair and this is where it and its cargo happened to come * to rest , facing the wall . Not wanting to lose the call , Sayer moves toward the patient , keeping the receiver to his ear . At full extension of the cord , unfortunately , he 's still two paces short . Reaching back with the arm with the phone , he gains distance and turns the wheelchair quickly just as his call connects . SAYER : Yes . Hi . I need a lock installed on the door to the East Wing roof . A big lock . The sooner the better . ( pause ) I 'm sorry , this is Dr. Sayer. . ( pause ) I 'm sorry , form . . .

Another dayroom crowded with patients , one of which stands before a table , absolutely motionless , on thin bird-like legs . It is Lucy , the one who caught/the tennis ball . The movement of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness . Sayer considers her from all angles as one considers an abstract art piece that baffles but intrigues . Unlike the others , she 's on her feet . And unlike the others , she seems , to Sayer , to have been headed somewhere before turning to stone again . - . '' » He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain across the room . And that it 's the table , like a barrier , that has arrested her progress . He moves the table . In what appears to be slow motion , she takes a tiny step . And another . And another before encountering and being `` blocked '' by an empty wheelchair . She stops . Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her path . She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the fountain before mysteriously stopping again . Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers in her way , but she 's not moving . Defeated , he goes to the fountain himself , fills a paper cup , and takes it to her . Across the room , a man in a wheelchair , another `` ghost '' ( LEONARD ) , stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive . `` At '' Sayer . 27 . INT .

Raspberry JAM is spread on a piece of WHOLE GRAIN BREAD . INT . SUBARU TELESCOPE MAUNA KEA - NIGHT PhD candidate KATE DIBIASKY , 26 , dyed red hair , rides the fine line between geeky and alternative , walks up the stairs to a desk overlooking a giant telescope . A CARL SAGAN action figure is positioned next to the computer . Kate types coordinates . The TELESCOPE REPOSITIONS . AND THE ROOF OPENS revealing a starry night . And for the final preparatory touch Kate puts her ear buds in and HITS PLAY ON HER PHONE . MUSIC : WU-TANG CLAN AINT NUTHING TO F ’ WIT by Wu-Tang Clan Kate raps along under her breath . She also SELF BEEPS any questionable words without falling off the beat . As we hear Kate rap we cut back and forth between Kate ’ s COMPUTER SCREEN SHOWING A HARD TO DECIPHER IMAGE and A STUNNING REAL LIFE VIEW SPACE THAT ENDS ON A LITTLE SPIRAL GALAXY . She clicks several photos . QUICK TIME JUMP to her looking through photos but there ’ s .... nothing . Kate clicks through more photos . Still nothing . She sees something else , a small smudge of light . Quickly she takes more pictures . JUMP CUT : She walks over to a big screen and “ stretches ” the photo until a clearly visible “ streak ” is visible in the sky . Kate gasps and steps back to confirm what she sees is real . She stares , jaw dropped , at a giant screen of a comet . CUT TO : 2 . INT . SUBARU TELESCOPE - 2 IN THE MORNING - NIGHT MUSIC : RIGHT THURR by Chingy A “ Party ” is coming together with a group of 4 GRAD STUDENTS in their mid 20s , DANIEL , NISHA , OLIVER , WIN and their PROFESSOR from Michigan State , PROFESSOR RANDALL MINDY , 50s , Midwestern , bearded , not so ambitious since he got tenure . RANDALL This is nuts ! ! This is so crazy ... NISHA I ’ ve got a hard cider and a bag of Crossbone Crunch ! WIN It ’ s a party . RANDALL I ’ m just so , so thrilled for you Kate . ( raises a glass ) To “ Comet Dibiasky. ” Right ? Cheers ! Randall is transfixed by the pictures . RANDALL ( CONT 'D ) It ’ s got to be an Oort cloud comet just based on where you saw it . Probably the last time it got this close to the sun was long before human civilization . Look at the arc on that thing . My god that ’ s amazing . NISHA How would we find out the comet ’ s velocity and orbit Professor Mindy ? RANDALL What a great question . I haven ’ t done orbital dynamics since Grad school . The question is , “ What would Carl Sagan do ? ” He would take it back to first principles . Randall wheels over a white board . He begins to draw the XYZ Axis from FIGURE 1 . Daniel hands him a battered textbook . 3 . RANDALL ( CONT 'D ) The topocentric vector is rho ... Kate , what are the initial coordinates ? Kate is on her laptop . KATE 21 .... 24 ... 13 ... Quick time dashes as Randall writes more and more equations on the board and flips through the textbook . RANDALL This is fun , huh guys ? 67 ... KATE WIN Uh , Doctor Mindy , how many terms do you have to calculate to induce the FNG function ? RANDALL ( CONT 'D ) Wow , now you ’ re got me pumped . RANDALL ( CONT 'D ) All right , um -- This is a good approximation according to Marsden eighty-five . RANDALL ( CONT 'D ) Now that we have the comets orbit . We will check the ephemeris . And that will give us the distance between the comet and earth . Randall continues to map out the results on the white board . KATE Why does the ephemeris keep getting lower and lower ? Randall writes the last part of FIGURE 2 . And then finally ... he writes “ O.OO ” His hand is frozen with the marker in it in front of the board . KATE ( CONT 'D ) Professor Mindy ? ( beat ) Professor Mindy ? Randall quickly erases the “ 0.00 ” 4 . RANDALL You know what guys ? Let ’ s , uh , call it a night , huh ? WIN But what ’ s the relative position ? RANDALL I can ’ t figure it out , guys . Not tonight , sorry . DANIEL You know what , I ’ m beat . Me too . NISHA DANIEL Kate this was amazing . The Grad students shuffle off . Randall hasn ’ t taken his eyes off the board . RANDALL Hey Kate ? ... you stay .

OGLETHORPE Uh ... that ’ s a big boy . ( beat ) And was this Professor the one who made the observation ? Randall chimes in . RANDALL Uh , hi , yes , Dr. Mindy . And no , PHD candidate Kate Dibiasky found it , I did the orbital calculations . I study um , trace gases in dead galaxies . I haven ’ t published in awhile so you probably haven ’ t heard of me - but that doesn ’ t matter obviously - sorry . DR. OGLETHORPE And what are the most updated estimates on its trajectory ? Kate does more calculations on her Matlabs . KATE I ’ ve been running it all day , I keep getting the same result . A direct hit of earth in 6 months and 14 days . Me too . RANDALL DR.

KATE ( cuts to the quick ) What Dr. Mindy is trying to say is that there is a comet headed directly towards earth . He lays out the photos highlighting the blurry “ streak. ” The President and Jason examine the pictures . KATE ( CONT 'D ) According to NASA ’ s computers this object will hit the Pacific Ocean a sixty two miles due west off the coast of Chile . JASON And then what happens ? A tidal wave ? RANDALL No , it will be far more catastrophic . There will be milehigh tsunamis , fanning out all across the globe . If this comet makes impact , it will have the power of a billion Hiroshima bombs .

JASON Oh , great ! So it ’ s not 100 % . 22 . DR. OGLETHORPE Scientists never like to say 100 % . PRESIDENT ORLEAN Call it 70 % and let ’ s move on . KATE It ’ s not even close to seventy percent .

Do you want to see my goddam SAT scores ? 23 . PRESIDENT ORLEAN Okay , let ’ s bottom line this . What is this gon na cost me ? What ’ s the ask here ? DR. OGLETHORPE There are government plans in place . Actions we can take through NASA . Drones that can be outfitted with nukes to deflect and hopefully change the orbit of this comet . But we must act now . PRESIDENT ORLEAN Alright , alright , let me think here ... When are the midterms ? ... JASON Three weeks . PRESIDENT ORLEAN Three weeks . If this breaks before then we could lose Congress and then there ’ s nothing we can do about this anyway . JASON It ’ ll be gridlock . PRESIDENT ORLEAN Exactly , the timing ... it ’ s atrocious . ( breath ) At this exact moment ... I say we sit tight and assess . RANDALL Sit tight and assess ? PRESIDENT ORLEAN And let ’ s get some Ivy Leaguers , no offense .

JASON I ’ m the Chief of Staff , Boy with a Dragon Tattoo , so I ’ m doin ’ fine ! KATE ( whispers to Randall ) This place is a freak show . RANDALL I think what Ms. Dibiasky is trying to say is that the idea of sitting tight is an extremely dangerous idea . President Orlean discovers a pack of smokes in her desk . PRESIDENT ORLEAN Oh ! Oh ! ( looks up to the heavens ) Thank you ! ( back to the room ) Well at least one good thing happened today ! She pulls out a cigarette and lights it . PRESIDENT ORLEAN ( CONT 'D ) Funny story , when I ran for President I had to sneak cigarettes for the first month of the campaign . Photographs of me smoking were going for a hundred grand a shot .

As some of you know the most valuable minerals in the world are fast becoming the ones used to make cell phones and computers : yttrium , terbium , osmium , dysprosium , and on and on . We ’ re running short . And the problem is exacerbated because China has her big panda paw firmly on almost all the mines that produce these valuable rare earth assets . So you can imagine , wow , just how happy we were at BASH when our astrogeologists that this comet hurtling towards earth actually contains at least thirty-two trillion dollars of these critical materials . RANDALL I ’ m sorry , I ’ m sorry , is that why you aborted this entire mission because you are trying to mine the comet ? 76 .

PETER ISHERWELL Obviously , one giant comet is a major and existential threat to our planet ... But 30 smaller meteoroids we can handle . Our BEADS , which stands for BASH Explore and Acquire Drones , will attach to the comet and scan using Nano-technology developed by Nobel Prize winner Dr. Gary Talcamont here . And then we will then deploy Nobel and Polofsky prize winning scientist Dr. Inez ’ s micro targeted quantum fission explosives deep into the object . Dr. Inez , would you like to explain- 78 . COMET has been scanned on a 3D grid . IN THE ANIMATION the drones ATTACH USING THEIR DRILL BITS and BLAM ! DR. INEZ Thank you Peter . We ’ ve been developing phase fission reactions in the CERN particle accelerator that can splinter the comet into smaller pieces with breathtaking accuracy . These segments are then steered and decelerated by each BEAD into the Pacific Ocean for reclamation by waiting US Navy ships ... The animated drones then individually steer each piece of the comet into the Pacific ocean making a simple splash . PETER ISHERWELL And when these treasures from heaven are claimed , poverty as we know it , social injustice , lose of biodiversity , all these multitudes of problems will become relics of the past and humanity will stride through the pillars of Boaz and Jachin , naked into the glory of a golden age ...

Randall and President Orlean land in a helicopter and walk over to a hangar . A giant BEAD DRONE is in front of them . PETER ISHERWELL Okay , let me introduce you , uh , to mankind ’ s savior . The Bash Explore and Acquire Drone . RANDALL It ’ s incredible . PETER ISHERWELL It ’ s incredible , isn ’ t it ? I call this one Primo the first . ( laughs ) It ’ s like my first child . ( speaking to drone ) Primo , my boy . It ’ s your father , Cronos . ( laughing ) Don ’ t be shy . Come on . You ’ re gon na be a God in the sky .

There are always questions and fears and ... Randall takes some papers from his jacket . Hands them to Isherwell . 91 . RANDALL Right . I have a report here from a Dr. Inez if you ’ d just take a look at this study . PETER ISHERWELL Oh , thanks ... RANDALL Listen , a lot of my colleagues , they ’ ve either been removed or resigned from this project , apparently for asking too many questions about this mission here . So I just wan na make sure that you ’ re open to the scientific peerreview process and you ’ re not approaching this entire mission like a businessman . PETER ISHERWELL What did you say ? RANDALL I wan na know if you ’ reBeat . Uh-oh . Wrong thing to say . A hint of anger flashes in Isherwell ’ s eyes . PETER ISHERWELL Did you call me a businessman ? RANDALL You do own a corporatePETER ISHERWELL You think I ’ m just a businessman ? Do you think you know me , Doctor ? Business ? This is evolution . This is evolution of the human species . ( To President Orlean ) What are you doing bringing this ( Back to Randall ) Did you know that BASH has over 40 million data points on you and every decision you ’ ve made since 1994 , Doctor ? I know when you have colon polyps months before your doctor does . You ’ ve got four or five at the moment , actually . You know , they ’ re not of concern , but I ’ d have a checkup as soon as you can . ( MORE ) 92 . PETER ISHERWELL ( CONT 'D ) But more importantly than that , much more importantly , I know what you are . I know who you are . My algorithms have determined eight fundamental consumer profile types . You are a Lifestyle Idealist . You think you are motivated by beliefs , high ethical beliefs , but you just run towards pleasure and away from pain . Like a field mouse . RANDALL ( almost in a whisper ) I just want to make sure the science is sound on this project . I hope you understand Isherwell gets right in Randall ’ s face . PETER ISHERWELL Our algorithms can even predict how you ’ ll die with up to 96 % accuracy . I looked you up after we first met . Your death was so unremarkable and boring ... I can ’ t even remember what it said . Apart from one thing . You ’ re going to die alone . Randall shakes his head . PETER ISHERWELL ( CONT 'D ) Alone . If you ’ ll excuse me Madam President . I ’ ve got some work to do . Isherwell leaves . PRESIDENT ORLEAN What the hell are you doing ? My God ... RANDALL I ’ m trying to do my job . PRESIDENT ORLEAN You are just so lucky Peter adores you .

That sound right to you ? FRIEND You know Isherwell built an underground bunker for him and all his executives . TEEN GIRL No , I heard they ’ re building an escape ship .

The studio lights somehow brighter . JACK BREMMER Dr. Randall . How are you sir ? RANDALL I ’ m good . Gooder ... than good ! Tiny awkward beat . Tepid laughs from the crew . BRIE EVANTEE So Randall , we ’ re hearing there ’ s no comet , that there is a comet but it ’ s a good thing , or maybe it ’ s a bad thing . We are so confused . BRIE EVANTEE ( CONT 'D ) So could you please help us out here , oh , wise scientist ? RANDALL Well ... uh ... first and foremost , Brie , there most certainly is a comet . All right . BRIE EVANTEE RANDALL And we know that there is a comet because we have the data . There has been growing concern within the scientific community as of late . You see , the peer-review process is absolutely essential ... JACK BREMMER Well listen , if BASH ’ s stock is any indicator , then we don ’ t have to worry about the peer review . It is going gangbusters . And listen , full disclosure , I bought as many shares as I could . I advise you to do the same . BRIE EVANTEE You are such a shameless capitalist . 96 . JACK BREMMER Said the woman who will be in the brand-new hot tub on my back deck when I put it in . BRIE EVANTEE He knows me too well . Dr. Randall , are you sure you ’ re okay ? Do you want a glass of water ? RANDALL I don ’ t feel so well ... BRIE EVANTEE Okay ... Well , we ’ re going to go to a commercial and come backRANDALL NO please Brie , don ’ t cut away . Let me say something . JACK BREMMER Well you came to the right place . Because on this show , we like to say things . RANDALL WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP BEING SO FUCKING PLEASANT ! Everyone goes quiet . RANDALL ( CONT 'D ) I ’ m sorry . Not everything needs to sound so goddamn clever or charming or likable all the time . Sometimes , we just need to be able to say things to one another . We need to hear things . Look , let ’ s establish , once again , that there is a huge comet headed towards Earth . And the reason we know that there is a coment is because we saw it . We saw it with our own eyes using a telescope . I mean , for God ’ s sake , we took a FUCKING PICTURE OF IT ! What other proof do we need ? And if we can ’ t all agree at the bare minimum that a giant comet the size of Mount Everest hurtling its way toward planet Earth is NOT A FUCKING GOOD THING , then what the hell happened to us ? ( MORE ) 97 . RANDALL ( CONT 'D ) I mean , my God , how do- How do we even talk to each other ? What have we done to ourselves ? How do we fix it ? We should ’ ve deflected this comet when we had the fucking chance , but we didn ’ t do it . I don ’ t know why we didn ’ t do it . Brie , Jack , and the crew stare at Randall with concern . RANDALL ( CONT 'D ) And now they ’ re actually firing scientists like me for speaking out , for opposing them . And I ; m sure many of the people out there aren ’ t even going to listen to what I just said because they have their own political ideaology . But , I assure you , I am not on one side or the other . I ’ m just telling you the fucking truth . BRIE EVANTEE I think this would be a good time to establish that Isherwell and the President that there ’ s benefits to be hadRANDALL Right , well , the President of the United States is FUCKING LYING . Look , I ’ m just like all of you ... I hope to GOD , I hope to GOD that this President knows what she ’ s doing ... I hope she ’ s got us all taken care of . But the truth is , I think this whole administration has COMPLETELY LOST THEIR FUCKING MIND . AND I THINK WE ’ RE ALL GON NA DIE . ( softly ) Look , I just wan na go home . I just wan na go home more than anything . ( breathing heavily ) But if there is one thing , one thing that I pray that all of you hear from what I have just said ... is that all of us , all of usEXT .

ALAN TURING ’ S HOUSE - DAY - 1951 A HALF-DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS swarm the Manchester home of mathematics professor Alan Turing . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) Good . This is going to go very quickly now . If you are not listening carefully , you will miss things . Important things . You ’ re writing some of this down ? That ’ s good . INSIDE ALAN ’ S HOUSE : There 's been a break-in , and the house is a mess - someone has given it a pretty thorough once-over . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) I will not pause , I will not repeat myself , and you will not interrupt me . If you ask me a question , I will ignore it . You think that because you ’ re sitting where you are , and I am sitting where I am , that you are in control of what is about to happen . You ’ re mistaken . I am in control , because I know things that you do not know . PAPERS inked black with mathematical symbols litter the floor . The test tubes and beakers of Turing 's chemical work are shattered in the study , CYANIDE and POTASSIUM NITRATE DRIPPING ACROSS THE UGLY CARPET . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) What I will need from you now is a commitment . You will listen closely , and you will not judge me . And , in the corner : A MACHINE . It ’ s the size of a dresser , tall , sprouting VACUUM TUBES and WIRES . It looks anachronistic here , too futuristic for its time . The CONSTABLES LOOK AT THE MACHINE , CONFUSED : What is that thing ? 2 . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) When I am finished — when I have told you that I am finished — you are free to think whatever you like . But until then , you will trust that while this story will be hard for you to understand , everything I am saying I am saying for a reason .

POLICE HEADQUATERS - DAY — At headquarters , a RADIO GIRL RECEIVES the information and passes it to an assistant for delivery to the detectives on duty — INT . MI-6 - RADIO OPERATORS ’ ROOM/HALLWAYS - DAY — While in London , a RADIO OPERATOR in a dark room far below Victoria Street INTERCEPTS THE MESSAGE — ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) If you can not commit to this , then please leave the room . That ’ s right , you ’ re the one who ’ s free to go . But if you choose to stay , if you choose to listen , remember this : If things happen that you do not like , you chose to be here . — The MESSAGE is HANDED OFF and WHISKED through the dim hallways — INT . MI-6 - MENZIES OFFICE - DAY — Until it ’ s finally deposited on the desk of STEWART MENZIES , the Director of MI-6 . British Secret Intelligence Services . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) What happens from this moment forward is not my responsibility : It ’ s yours . Menzies picks up the message : “ Alan Turing has been robbed. ” ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) This will go quite fast now . ( laughs ) And that is the last time I will repeat myself . Pay attention . 3 . EXT . ALAN TURNING ’ S HOUSE - MORNING DETECTIVE ROBERT NOCK , 40s , athletic , more interested in football than being a detective , hustles past a few doubleparked police cars and up the steps and into : INT . ALAN TURNING ’ S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Detective Nock enters to find the same messy crime scene we just saw . He ’ s addressed by SERGEANT STAEHL . SGT . STAEHL Bit late , don ’ t you think ? DETECTIVE NOCK The baby . Up all night , hollering and crying . June says it ’ s collick . ( re : the mess ) What ’ s all this , then ? SGT . STAEHL Turing , Alan . Professor at King ’ s . Seems there ’ s been a robbery . What of ? DETECTIVE NOCK SGT . STAEHL That ’ s just it . Nothing ’ s missing , really . DETECTIVE NOCK No , what ’ s he a professor of ? SGT . STAEHL ( consulting notes ) Maths . Or , as he put it , “ ordinal logic , with a dose of number theory. ” ON NOCK : What on earth does that mean ? Staehl shrugs . DETECTIVE NOCK What ’ s he doing in Manchester ? Sergeant Staehl shows Nock the MACHINE in the corner . ON NOCK : What the hell is that ? SGT . STAEHL Something with machines . Project at the NPL , I checked , but he won ’ t say what it ’ s on . 4 . DETECTIVE NOCK He ’ s a bit squirrely then , our Professor Turing ? SGT . STAEHL That ’ s putting it mildly . Sergeant Staehl motions to the next room , and he follows Nock in ... ... Where they find ALAN TURING , 38 . He ’ s the smartest man in the room , and he knows it . But he doesn ’ t really care if you do . Turing is VERY CAREFULLY sweeping up a pile of WHITE POWDER . He ’ s doing it with a PAINTBRUSH , his mouth covered in a scarf . He ’ s totally oblivious to the detectives as they enter . DETECTIVE NOCK Professor Turing ? ( beat ) Professor Turing ? My name is Detective Nock . Manchester Police . Sergeant Staehl here tells me you ’ ve had a robbery last night . ( still nothing ) Professor Turing ? Detective Nock steps closer , peering over Turing ’ s shoulder at the white powder . DETECTIVE NOCK ( CONT ’ D ) Professor — ALAN TURING — I would step back , if I were you . DETECTIVE NOCK Pardon me ? ALAN TURING Step back , and don ’ t breathe so much . DETECTIVE NOCK Breathe ? ALAN TURING You ’ re breathing heavily and you ’ re going to inhale this junk and you ’ re going to leave your collicky son without a father . 5 . Detective Nock stops , and steps back . What in the world ? ALAN TURING ( CONT ’ D ) Sound carries in this house . DETECTIVE NOCK What is all that ? ALAN TURING Cyanide . Undiluted . Wouldn ’ t take more than a thimbleful to kill you . Turing finishes sweeping the cyanide into a jar , before safely CAPPING IT . Turing stands , removes his scarf , and for the first time takes a look at Detective Nock . Sizes him up . ALAN TURING ( CONT ’ D ) Oh . Disappointing . Detective Knock and Sergeant Staehl exchange a look . DETECTIVE NOCK Pardon ? ALAN TURING I ’ d hoped for a bit more . DETECTIVE NOCK Sergeant Staehl , is it just me , or do you get the sense that we ’ re being insulted ? ALAN TURING ( to Nock ) You lied to your friend here about your son , which is just unseemly . Collick didn ’ t keep you up all night . Drink did . You ’ ve bags under your eyes the size of strawberries . Your topcoat reeks of whiskey . You ’ re short of breath after walking 30 paces . And I believe Manchester United had a match yesterday , yes ? I could hear the shouting from Simpson ’ s on my way home . DETECTIVE NOCK ( caught ) ... We won by four . Would ’ ve been unseemly not to celebrate . Sergeant Staehl SIGHS , embarrassed . 6 . SGT . STAEHL You had a break in last night . Your neighbor , a Mr. Springborn , called to report the noise . Only you say there ’ s nothing missing . Odd . So how about it — You tell us what happened , and we find the chap who did this . ALAN TURING Gentlemen , I don ’ t think you could figure out who broke into my house if he walked up and spat in your face . What I could really use at the moment is not a bobby but a good cleaning lady . So unless one of you has an apron in your car , I ’ d suggest that you file your reports and leave me alone . Staehl is about to say something — and probably something aggressive , by the look of his face — but Nock stops him . DETECTIVE NOCK ... As you say , Professor Turing . Best of luck with your cyanide . EXT . ALAN TURNING ’ S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Detective Nock and Sergeant Staehl walk away from Turing ’ s house . SGT . STAEHL I ’ ll give you a bob if you can name me a more insufferable sod . DETECTIVE NOCK Curious , isn ’ t he ? SGT . STAEHL Oh , you ’ ve a soft spot for the bastard ‘ cause he called you on your drink ? Which , while we ’ re on the subject — DETECTIVE NOCK — Seemed a bit forced though , didn ’ t it ? SGT . STAEHL Don ’ t know what you mean . 7 . DETECTIVE NOCK If you didn ’ t want a pair of bobbies digging around in your personal affairs , well , that would have been a stellar way to see that they don ’ t . Tell me you don ’ t think this is suspicious . SGT . STAEHL I don ’ t think this is suspicious . DETECTIVE NOCK A mysterious professor who won ’ t admit he ’ s had something stolen from his flat ? SGT . STAEHL What ’ re you suggesting ? DETECTIVE NOCK I ’ m suggesting that Alan Turing is hiding something . CUT TO : INT .

The station is preparing for war : PAPERBOYS SCREAM the headlines : “ 800,000 CHILDREN EVACUATED ! ” “ GERMAN BOMBS COMING ! ” “ FOOD SUPPLIES RATIONED ! ” MILITARY PERSONNEL herd PACKS OF CHILDREN like cattle onto rumbling trains . The children , born with stiff upper lips , hold back their tears . A FATHER shakes the hand of his 8-YEAR-OLD SON goodbye , almost business-like . Neither knows if they ’ ll ever see one another again . Alan moves through this determinedly , methodically , and unemotionally — it ’ s like he doesn ’ t even notice anyone is there . INT/EXT . TRAIN - DAY - LATER Alan Turing walks down the aisle of a train bound for Bletchley Park — his is the only adult face amidst the sea of children . 8 . He watches a SMALL BOY pour over a PUZZLE BOOK . OLDER KIDS , loud and rowdy , TAUNT the Small Boy , who doesn ’ t look up , he ’ s so focused on his puzzles . Alan watches . Maybe he smiles . Maybe he understands . EXT . BLETCHLEY VILLAGE - STREET - A FEW HOURS LATER Alan walks through the small village of Bletchley . He passes a sign that reads “ BLETCHLEY RADIO MANUFACTURING ” as he heads to EXT . BLETCHLEY PARK - AN HOUR LATER Alan arrives at the imposing front gates of Bletchley Park . An enormous Victorian mansion lies in the center of the grounds , surrounded by empty gardens and tall iron fences . As Alan approaches , two NAVAL OFFICERS with MACHINE GUNS step out from behind the BARRICADES . Whatever this place is , it ’ s housing something very secret inside . INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - COMMANDER DENNISTON ’ S OFFICE - LATER A few minutes later , Alan sits alone in a cluttered office . He stares ahead blankly at the empty chair behind the desk . Waits . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( O.S . ) — What are you doing here ? Alan turns with a start . ALAN TURING The girl told me to wait — COMMANDER DENNISTON In my office ? She tell you to help yourself to a cup of tea while you were here ? ALAN TURING No . She didn ’ t . COMMANDER DENNISTON She didn ’ t tell you what a joke is then either , I gather . ALAN TURING Was she supposed to ? 9 . COMMANDER DENNISTON For Christ ’ s sake — who are you ? ALAN TURING Alan Turing . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( looking at papers on his desk ) Turing ... Let me see ... Oh , Turing . The mathematician . Correct . ALAN TURING COMMANDER DENNISTON How ever could I have guessed ? ALAN TURING You didn ’ t . It was written on your paper . COMMANDER DENNISTON ... King ’ s College , Cambridge . Says here you were a bit of a prodigy in the maths department . ALAN TURING I ’ m not sure I can evaluate that , Mr ... ? COMMANDER DENNISTON How old are you , Mr. Turing ? 27 . ALAN TURING COMMANDER DENNISTON How old were you when you became a fellow at Cambridge ? 24 . ALAN TURING COMMANDER DENNISTON And how old were you when you published this paper here , that has a title I can barely understand , which apparently got you this fellowship ? 23 . ALAN TURING 10 . COMMANDER DENNISTON And you don ’ t think that qualifies you as a certified prodigy ? ALAN TURING Rather depends on how old my peers were when they did comparable work , doesn ’ t it ? COMMANDER DENNISTON And how old were they ? ALAN TURING Newton discovered the binomial theorem at 22 . Einstein published four papers that changed the world at 26 . As far as I can tell I ’ ve barely made par . COMMANDER DENNISTON You ’ re serious , aren ’ t you ? ALAN TURING Would you prefer I make a joke ? COMMANDER DENNISTON Not sure you know what those are . ALAN TURING It hardly seems fair that that would be a requirement for employment here , Mr ... ? COMMANDER DENNISTON Commander Denniston , of the Royal Navy . All right , Mr. Turing , I ’ ll bite . Why do you want to work for His Majesty ’ s government ? ALAN TURING Oh , I don ’ t , really . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( suspicious ) Are you a bleeding pacifist , Turing ? ALAN TURING I ’ m agnostic about violence . COMMANDER DENNISTON But you realize that 600 miles from London there ’ s this nasty chap named Hitler who ’ s looking to engulf Europe in tyranny ? 11 . ALAN TURING Politics is not my area of expertise . COMMANDER DENNISTON I believe you ’ ve just set a record for the shortest job interview in British military history . ALAN TURING Mother says that I can be offputting sometimes . On account of being the best mathematician in the world . COMMANDER DENNISTON You ’ re the best mathematician in the world ? Oh . Yes . ALAN TURING COMMANDER DENNISTON ... Do you know how many people I ’ ve rejected for this program ? No . ALAN TURING COMMANDER DENNISTON That ’ s right . Because we ’ re a top secret program . But I ’ ll tell you , just because we ’ re friends , that last week I rejected one of our great nation ’ s top linguists , knows German better than Bertolt Brecht . ALAN TURING I don ’ t speak German . What ? COMMANDER DENNISTON ALAN TURING I don ’ t . Speak German . COMMANDER DENNISTON How the bloody hell are you supposed to decrypt German communications if you don ’ t , oh , I don ’ t know , speak German ? ALAN TURING I ’ m quite excellent at crossword puzzles . 12 . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( calling off ) MARGARET ! ALAN TURING The German codes are a puzzle . A game . Just like any other game . COMMANDER DENNISTON MARGARET ! Where are you ? ! ALAN TURING I ’ m very good at games . Puzzles . And I think this is the hardest puzzle in the world . COMMANDER DENNISTON MARGARET ! ? ! ( beat ) For the love of ... This is a joke , obviously . ALAN TURING I ’ m afraid I can ’ t make jokes , Commander Denniston . And for a split second , Denniston actually smiles . COMMANDER DENNISTON Have a pleasant trip back to Cambridge , Professor . Enigma . ALAN TURING At the mention of this word Denniston looks suddenly serious . SECRETARY ( ” MARGARET ” ) ( popping head in ) You called for me ? He WAVES HER AWAY , entirely focused on what Alan just said . ALAN TURING ( after she leaves ) ... That ’ s what you ’ re doing here . The top secret program at Bletchley . You ’ re trying to break the German Enigma machine . COMMANDER DENNISTON What makes you think that ? ALAN TURING It ’ s the greatest encryption device in history , and the Germans use it for all major communications . ( MORE ) 13 . ALAN TURING ( CONT 'D ) If the Allies broke Enigma — well , this would turn into a very short war indeed . Of course you ’ re working on it . But you also haven ’ t got anywhere . If you had , you wouldn ’ t be hiring cryptographers out of University . You need me a lot more than I need you . I ’ d just as easily go work for the Germans , frankly , but they simply don ’ t have anything this good to work on . Our mathematicians aren ’ t as impressive as theirs . With one significant exception . I like solving problems , Commander . And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world . COMMANDER DENNISTON Enigma isn ’ t difficult . It ’ s impossible . The Americans . The French . The Russians . The Germans . Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable . ALAN TURING Goody ! Let me try and we ’ ll know for sure . The men stare at each other . Neither blinks . INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - DAY - LATER ANGLE ON : A machine . It looks like a typewriter that got left on the set of Blade Runner . Wires running all over it . Extra gears sticking out of the sides . Blinking lights that reveal German characters . Half electrical , half mechanical . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( O.S . ) Welcome to Enigma . SLOWLY REVEAL : COMMANDER DENNISTON , 50s , is showing the ENIGMA MACHINE to the NEW RECRUITS . They are : HUGH ALEXANDER , 30s , loves women and chess in equal measure . JOHN CAIRNCROSS , 30s , Scottish , not the prodigy his compatriots are and knows it . PETER HILTON , 20s , a precocious undergrad from Oxford . KEITH FURMAN and CHARLES RICHARDS , 40s , both stodgy linguists . 14 . Stewart Menzies — head of MI-6 , who we briefly glimpsed in the opening — stands in the corner , silent and observing . Charming and inscrutable , he didn ’ t become the head of British Secret Intelligence Services by accident . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( CONT ’ D ) The German navy encodes every message they send using the Enigma machine . The details of every surprise attack , of every secret convoy , of every U-Boat in the bloody Atlantic go into that thing , and out comes ... Gibberish . FINALLY REVEAL : ... Alan stands with them , staring at the machine like it ’ s the Sistine Chapel . He reaches out and touches it lovingly . ALAN TURING It ’ s beautiful . COMMANDER DENNISTON It ’ s the crooked hand of death itself . Denniston shows Alan sheets of Enigma messages : PAGE AFTER PAGE OF RANDOM LETTERS . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( CONT ’ D ) Our WRENs intercept thousands of radio messages a day . But to the lovely young ladies of the Women ’ s Royal Navy , they ’ re nonsense . It ’ s only when you feed them back into Enigma that they make sense . JOHN CAIRNCROSS But we have an Enigma machine . COMMANDER DENNISTON Yes . Polish intelligence smuggled this out of Berlin . JOHN CAIRNCROSS So what ’ s the problem ? Just put the intercepted messages back in to Enigma and — ALAN TURING — It ’ s not that simple , is it ? Just having an Enigma machine doesn ’ t help you decode the messages . 15 . COMMANDER DENNISTON Very good , Mr. Turing . To decode a message , you need to know the machine ’ s settings . The Germans switch settings every day , promptly at midnight . We usually intercept our first message around 6am . Which gives you exactly 18 hours every day to crack the code before it changes , and you start again . Alan looks at the machine carefully . ALAN TURING Five rotors . Six plugboard cables . That ’ s ... Five — CHARLES RICHARDS JOHN CAIRNCROSS — thousand million — PETER HILTON — No no it ’ s — I ’ ve got it — CHARLES RICHARDS — Million , million — KEITH FURMAN — In the millions , obviously — CHARLES RICHARDS — Obviously — ALAN TURING — Over one hundred and fifty million million million possible settings . All eyes turn to Turing : Wow . COMMANDER DENNISTON ... Very good . HUGH ALEXANDER One hundred fifty nine , if you ’ d rather be exact about it . Everyone looks at Hugh now . HUGH ALEXANDER ( CONT ’ D ) One five nine with eighteen zeroes behind it . Possibilities . Every single day . Jesus Christ . Who is this guy ? 16 . COMMANDER DENNISTON Gentlemen , meet Hugh Alexander . I ’ ve personally selected him to run this unit . JOHN CAIRNCROSS Didn ’ t you ... ? COMMANDER DENNISTON Mr. Alexander won Britain ’ s national chess championship . Twice . HUGH ALEXANDER JOHN CAIRNCROSS ( extending a hand to Hugh ) John Cairncross . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( to Alan ) You ’ re not the only one who ’ s good at games around here . ALAN TURING Are we all to work together then ? I prefer to have my own office . COMMANDER DENNISTON You ’ re a team , and you ’ ll work as one . ALAN TURING I don ’ t have time to explain myself as I go along , and I ’ m afraid these men will only slow me down . STEWART MENZIES ( piping up from the corner ) — If you can ’ t play together , then I ’ m afraid we can ’ t let you play at all . They all stare at him . COMMANDER DENNISTON This is Stuart Menzies . MI-6 . The team ACKNOWLEDGES Menzies . CHARLES RICHARDS There are only five divisions of military intelligence . There is no “ MI-6. ” 17 . STEWART MENZIES Exactly . That ’ s the spirit . ( to Alan ) Mr. Turing . Do you know how many British servicemen have died because of Enigma ? I don ’ t . Three . ALAN TURING STEWART MENZIES They all stare at Menzies : That doesn ’ t sound like very many . STEWART MENZIES ( CONT ’ D ) ... While we ’ ve been having this conversation . ( checks his watch ) Oh look . There ’ s another . Rather hope he didn ’ t have a family . This war that Commander Denniston ’ s been going on about ? We ’ re not winning it . Break the code and at least we might have a chance . ( to Denniston ) Shall we leave the children alone with their new toy ? Menzies and Commander Denniston LEAVE . The team stands there . With Enigma . HUGH ALEXANDER Alright boys . Let ’ s play . CUT TO : EXT . SHERBORNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY - 1927 TEENAGE BOYS play cricket in the green front gardens of a boys boarding school . Behind them looms the school ’ s stately central manor house . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) The problem began , of course , with the carrots . INT . SHERBORNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY YOUNG ALAN TURING , 15 , sits alone in the dining hall . Other BOYS joke and laugh and tell animated stories at nearby tables , but Alan sits alone , staring intently at his food . 18 . ON ALAN ’ S PLATE : Boiled steak . Potatoes . Peas . And carrots . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) Carrots are orange . Peas are green . They mustn ’ t touch . Alan carefully tries to separate the carrots from the peas . It ’ s like he ’ s performing brain surgery . BEHIND ALAN , a group of BIGGER BOYS approach quietly . One of them holds a TRAY OF BOILED VEGETABLES — — The Boys try to MUFFLE THEIR GIGGLES so Alan can ’ t hear them approach — — The Boys DUMP THE TRAY OF VEGETABLES ALL OVER ALAN . Alan SCREAMS . The Boys LAUGH as Alan SCREAMS and SHAKES and tries to get the peas and carrots and everything else off of him . He ’ s in hell . Alan FALLS DOWN . Still shaking , still screaming . YOUNG ALAN Carrots are orange ! Carrots are orange ! Carrots are orange ! BOY # 1 What a bloody weirdo ! Alan CURLS UP INTO A BALL as he shivers . CUT TO : INT . COFFIN - A FEW MINUTES LATER ... Alan is now inside a coffin . He ’ s KICKING AT THE WOODEN BOARDS ABOVE and SCREAMING TO BE RELEASED . It ’ s not helping . From above , we hear the familiar LAUGHTER OF THE SCHOOLBOYS . REVEAL : The “ coffin ” is make-shift ; the Boys have constructed it out of the broken floorboards of a half-finished class room . Alan is buried underground , and they ’ re nailing him in . 19 . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) Do you know why people like violence ? Because it feels good . The THUMP THUMP of nails entering the boards . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) Humans find violence deeply satisfying . But remove the satisfaction , and the act becomes ... Hollow . FROM INSIDE THE COFFIN : Alan goes silent . The Boys pound away , but the silence unnerves them . BOY # 1 Alan ? Alan ? BOY # 2 C ’ mon don ’ t be such a kike about it ... BOY # 3 Leave him to bloody rot . The Boys LEAVE . There ’ s still only SILENCE from inside Alan ’ s coffin . Alan breathes slowly . Quietly . Controls his shivering to barely a tremor . He waits . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) I didn ’ t learn this on my own though . I had help . Suddenly , the boards above him CREAK . Then BEND . Then SNAP . Then an ARM REACHES DOWN and PULLS Alan out of the coffin . REVEAL : CHRISTOPHER MORCOM , 16 , tall , pretty , and charming in ways that Alan will never , ever be . CHRISTOPHER Christ , I thought they were going to kill you . Christopher PULLS Alan from the floorboard coffin and they — EXT . SHERBORNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - SECONDS LATER Walking away from the half-finished school room , Christopher helps Alan as he hobbles . 20 . YOUNG ALAN ... It ’ s not my fault . The carrots got in with the peas . ( off Christopher ’ s look ) I ’ m sorry . I won ’ t let them do it again . CHRISTOPHER They ’ re getting worse . YOUNG ALAN They only beat me up because I ’ m smarter than they are . CHRISTOPHER No . They beat you up because you ’ re different . So you ’ ll have to try a little harder to blend in . YOUNG ALAN Mother says I ’ m just an odd duck . CHRISTOPHER And she ’ s right . Alan STUMBLES and Christopher grabs his hand , steadying him . CHRISTOPHER ( CONT ’ D ) But you know , sometimes it is the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine . ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) Christopher helped . CUT TO : INT . POLICE STATION - MANCHESTER - DAY - 1951 Detective Nock sits at his desk , yelling incredulously into his telephone . DETECTIVE NOCK ... What do you mean , “ classified ” ? ( beat ) ... Yes , I am aware of the literal meaning of the word “ classified , ” what I ’ m asking is why would a maths professor have his military records classified ? ( beat ) ... Well then I will come down there and ... 21 . Nock HANGS UP , frustrated . He notices Sergeant Staehl walking past . DETECTIVE NOCK ( CONT ’ D ) Come with me . EXT . MANCHESTER STREETS - LATER Detective Nock and Sergeant Staehl walk through Manchester , away from the police station . SGT . STAEHL ... So are you going to catch this mysterious thief who hasn ’ t actually stolen anything ? DETECTIVE NOCK Alan Turing is a suspect in a robbery but they won ’ t share a thing with the police ? SGT . STAEHL “ Suspect ” ? I distinctly recall writing his name next to the word “ victim. ” Nock looks around , paying no attention to Staehl . He sees something ( which we don ’ t ) in the reflection of a shop window . DETECTIVE NOCK Will ? SGT . STAEHL Yes ? DETECTIVE NOCK I ’ m terribly sorry about this . Suddenly , Nock PUSHES Staehl , hard . Staehl , reeling , is very , very confused . SGT . STAEHL What ? Nock responds by PUNCHING Staehl across the jaw , sending him to the ground . People on the street TURN and STARE . Nock RUNS away down the street — 22 . Staehl starts CHASING AFTER HIM — — They each DODGE PASSERSBY , who are all staring — — Until Nock suddenly CHANGES DIRECTIONS and SLAMS INTO A PEDESTRIAN — — The Pedestrian and Nock TUMBLE TO THE GROUND . The two SCRAMBLE , and then exchange a look : The Pedestrian is ... Concerned . The Pedestrian STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET and RUNS OFF . Nock stands dusting himself off as Staehl catches up to him — — And PUNCHES NOCK IN THE JAW . DETECTIVE NOCK Oww ! Would you stop it ? SGT . STAEHL What is wrong with you ? DETECTIVE NOCK Here .

If you ’ d like to discuss the complaint , I ’ d suggest making a proper appointment with my office . ALAN TURING Complaint ? Hugh Alexander has denied my requisition . Parts and equipment , to build the machine I ’ ve designed . COMMANDER DENNISTON Your fellow codebreakers are refusing to work with you . They ’ ve filed a formal complaint . ALAN TURING It ’ s inspired by an old Polish code machine , only infinitely more advanced . COMMANDER DENNISTON If you don ’ t respond to the complaint , I ’ ll have to take it up with the Home Office . ALAN TURING Fine . My response is , they are all idiots . Fire them and use the savings to fund my machine . I ’ ll only need about a hundred thousand pounds . COMMANDER DENNISTON A hundred thousand — Why are you building a machine ? ALAN TURING It ’ s highly technical . You wouldn ’ t understand . 31 . COMMANDER DENNISTON I suggest you make an effort to try . ALAN TURING ... Enigma is a machine . A very well-designed machine . Our problem is that we ’ re trying to beat it with men . What if only a machine can defeat another machine ? Denniston stares at him . COMMANDER DENNISTON ... Hugh Alexander is in charge of your unit and if he ’ s said no , that ’ s that . ALAN TURING I do not have time for this — COMMANDER DENNISTON — Have you ever won a war before , Turing ? I have . Do you know how it ’ s done ? Order . Discipline . Chain of command . You ’ re not at University any longer . You are a very small cog in a very large system and you ’ ll do as your commanding officer instructs . ALAN TURING Who is your commanding officer ?

KEITH FURMAN — This is a terrible plan — PETER HILTON — No no no no no no — ALAN TURING — Really ? I can give these men orders now ? COMMANDER DENNISTON Though I hate to say it ... Yes . ALAN TURING Fantastic . ( to Keith and Charles ) Keith and Charles . You ’ re both fired . KEITH FURMAN Excuse me ? CHARLES RICHARDS What ? ALAN TURING You ’ re mediocre linguists and positively poor codebreakers . HUGH ALEXANDER Alan , you can ’ t just fire Keith and Charles . 33 . ALAN TURING He just said I could . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( furious ) I did no such thing . STEWART MENZIES But Churchill did . Denniston looks at Menzies , stewing , but Menzies just shrugs back : “ What would you have me do ? ” CHARLES RICHARDS ( to Alan ) Go to hell . Charles and Keith leave , pissed . JOHN CAIRNCROSS This is inhuman . Even for you . ON DENNISTON : He looks at Alan with a withering , simmering glare .

ON ALAN ’ S FRANTIC PACING : Why isn ’ t it working ? Why ? ! Alan rubs his eyes , exhausted , and as he does so he looks out the window to see ... ... Commander Denniston walking towards the Machine Hut , accompanied by a HOME OFFICE MAN and TWO RMPs . Alan quickly runs to the door and BOLTS it — — Just as Denniston and the men get to it from the outside . OUTSIDE : Denniston tries the door . It won ’ t open . COMMANDER DENNISTON Turing ! Open the bloody door ! INSIDE : ALAN TURING No ! ! ! OUTSIDE : COMMANDER DENNISTON Open the door or we will break it down ! ! INSIDE : ALAN TURING I can not let you in ! ! I can not let you interfere ! ! ! OUTSIDE : Denniston turns to the RMPs : Break it down . The RMPs KICK DOWN THE DOOR — — And the men BURST INTO THE ROOM as Alan FALLS BACK . 64 . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( re : the horrible noise ) Turn that thing off . An RMP walks over to Christopher — — Alan tries to stop him but they POINT GUNS AT HIM — — And so Alan watches in absolute horror as they TURN OFF THE MACHINE . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( CONT ’ D ) Well then . It seems your great big expensive machine doesn ’ t work . It does . ALAN TURING COMMANDER DENNISTON Wonderful . So you ’ ve broken Enigma then ? ALAN TURING It works ... It was just ... Still working . COMMANDER DENNISTON This is my associate from the Home Office . A hundred thousand pounds is quite a lot of money . He ’ s here to see what you have to show for it . ALAN TURING You will never understand the importance of what I ’ ve created here . Commander Denniston exchanges a look with the men : See what I mean ? COMMANDER DENNISTON Have you decrypted any German messages ? A single one ? Can you point to anything at all that you ’ ve achieved ? ON ALAN : He can ’ t . COMMANDER DENNISTON ( CONT ’ D ) Your funding is up , and our patience has expired . It is with such great pleasure that I finally get to say this : Alan Turing , you ’ re fired . 65 . ON ALAN : What can he do ? This is it ... COMMANDER DENNISTON ( CONT ’ D ) Please escort Mr. Turing from the premises . No . HUGH ALEXANDER ( O.S . ) Everyone turns to see Hugh , John , and Peter at the door , wearing fresh clothes . Pardon ? COMMANDER DENNISTON HUGH ALEXANDER God help me ... If you fire Alan , you ’ ll have to fire me too . COMMANDER DENNISTON What on earth are you saying ? HUGH ALEXANDER Trust me , no one wants to say this less than I do , but Alan ’ s right . His machine can work . At least it ’ s the best chance we ’ ve got . COMMANDER DENNISTON You must be joking . JOHN CAIRNCROSS If you fire them , you ’ ll have to fire me too . PETER HILTON And me . HUGH ALEXANDER We ’ re the best cryptographic minds in Britain . Are you going to fire us all ? Denniston looks to the Home Office Man , who NODS : Hugh is right . HUGH ALEXANDER ( CONT ’ D ) At least give us more time . Six more months , and if the machine doesn ’ t produce results we ’ ll go back to doing things the old way . COMMANDER DENNISTON ... One month . And then so help me God you are all gone . 66 . Denniston and his men LEAVE . The team breathes a sigh of relief : They ’ ve been given a temporary reprieve . ALAN TURING ... Thank you . HUGH ALEXANDER This machine better bloody work . CUT TO : INT . MANCHESTER POLICE STATION - DAY - 1951 Sergeant Staehl walks eagerly through the police station . He comes to an office marked “ SUPERINTENDANT SMITH ” , where he OPENS the door to find INT . MANCHESTER POLICE STATION - SMITH ’ S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Superintendant Smith and Detective Nock are in the middle of a genial conversation . The Superintendant turns to Staehl . SUPERINTENDANT SMITH Can I help you ? SERGEANT STAEHL Sirs , I think I ’ ve got him . SUPERINTENDANT SMITH Got who ? SERGEANT STAEHL Turing . Detective Nock looks at Staehl — “ Shhhh ! ” The Superintendant looks at Nock — “ You didn ’ t ... ” SERGEANT STAEHL ( CONT ’ D ) I trailed Turing to a pub last night , where he met a bloke . They exchanged an envelope . So I followed the guy , picked him up , gave him a good shake ... Here , I ’ ll show you . 67 . SUPERINTENDANT SMITH ( to Nock , angry ) You and I will discuss this later . ( to Staehl ) Sergeant . They follow Staehl out to ... INT . POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER As Nock and Smith stands outside the INTERROGATION ROOM , Sergeant Staehl points through the window in the door : Inside is ARNOLD MURRAY , 20s , nervous . SERGEANT STAEHL He ’ s a bloody poofter . He confessed . Staehl shows Nock and Smith a SIGNED STATEMENT . What ? DETECTIVE NOCK SERGEANT STAEHL The man admitted it . Arnold Murray . Bit of a hustler . Hangs around that pub , men pay him for a go . Turing is one of the men who paid . Only , Mr. Murray got the bright idea to rob Turing ’ s house after , with a friend . That ’ s what Turing was hiding : He ’ s a poof , not a spy . No . DETECTIVE NOCK SUPERINTENDANT SMITH This is good work , Sergeant . Quite good . DETECTIVE NOCK No , it ’ s not . SERGEANT STAEHL What ’ s the matter ? We can charge a university professor with indecency . DETECTIVE NOCK No . No . This is bloody rubbish . Turing is up to something important , not getting his jollies in some pub . 68 . SUPERINTENDANT SMITH He committed a crime . He broke the law . And with a bloke , Christ , it ’ s bloody disgusting . DETECTIVE NOCK I don ’ t care if it ’ s disgusting . This is not the investigation I was conducting . SUPERINTENDANT SMITH Clearly . ( to Staehl ) Bring him in . DETECTIVE NOCK Wait . Let me interrogate him . SUPERINTENDANT SMITH You ’ re asking me for a favour right now ? DETECTIVE NOCK Please . I know him . I know he ’ s hiding something and I know I can get him to talk ... Give me half an hour alone and then I swear to you I will spend the next month running errands on as many rubbish cases as you like . SUPERINTENDANT SMITH ... Fine . Now will someone get a warrant for the arrest of Alan Turing ? CUT TO : INT . JOAN ’ S FLAT - DAY - 1941 Joan comes home to her flat . She looks sad as she puts her key in the lock and opens the door . She enters to find : HUNDREDS OF MATHEMATICAL PAPERS ARE SCATTERED ALL OVER HER LIVING ROOM . She sighs . Alan ? JOAN CLARKE 69 . At the sound of her voice , Alan comes out of the wash room , wiping the shaving cream from his face . He ’ s moving and talking a mile a minute . ALAN TURING Christopher is simply not moving fast enough . JOAN CLARKE We should talk . Joan sits down , sadly . ALAN TURING ( totally oblivious ) Even with the diagonal board he ’ s not eliminating settings as quickly as — JOAN CLARKE Alan , I ’ m leaving . ALAN TURING You just walked in . JOAN CLARKE No . Bletchley . ALAN TURING What ? JOAN CLARKE It ’ s my parents ... I am twenty-five and I am unmarried and I am living alone ... And they want me home . ALAN TURING That ’ s ridiculous . JOAN CLARKE That ’ s my parents . ALAN TURING You can not leave . I won ’ t let you . JOAN CLARKE “ I ’ ll miss you. ” That ’ s what a normal person might say in this situation . ALAN TURING I don ’ t care what ’ s normal . JOAN CLARKE “ I ’ ll write. ” That ’ d work too . 70 . ALAN TURING No . This is unacceptable . You are not leaving and that is that . JOAN CLARKE What am I supposed to do , Alan ? I will not give up my parents . The world is burning to ash and they are my family and they want me home . ALAN TURING You have the opportunity here to make some actual use of your life — JOAN CLARKE — And end up like you ? No thanks . I ’ m sorry you ’ re lonely . I ’ m sorry no one likes you . But Enigma will not save you . Can you decypher that , you fragile narcissist ? Or do you need me to fetch your precious Christopher for help ? Silence . Alan looks like she just slapped him across the face . Which she basically did . JOAN CLARKE ( CONT ’ D ) ... I ’ m sorry . ALAN TURING I want you to stay because I like you . JOAN CLARKE I know . ALAN TURING I like talking to you . JOAN CLARKE I like talking to you , too , Alan . ALAN TURING What if you weren ’ t living alone ... If you had a husband ? JOAN CLARKE You have one in mind ? ALAN TURING I do . 71 . JOAN CLARKE Hugh is terribly attractive , I ’ ll give you that , but he ’ s really not the marrying type . ALAN TURING I wasn ’ t referring to Hugh . JOAN CLARKE Peter ? He ’ s so quiet ... Alan stares at Joan . She stares back . JOAN CLARKE ( CONT ’ D ) ( getting it ) Oh dear Lord . ALAN TURING This makes sense . JOAN CLARKE Did you just propose to me ? ALAN TURING It ’ s the logical thing to do . JOAN CLARKE This is ridiculous . ALAN TURING This is your parents . JOAN CLARKE ( trying to process ) I can not believe this is happening . Alan fishes a piece of ELECTRICAL WIRE from his pocket ... ALAN TURING Joan Ca ... Wait , is your middle name Caroline or Catherine ? JOAN CLARKE Elizabeth . ALAN TURING Joan Elizabeth Clarke , will you marry me ? ... And then FASHIONS IT INTO A RING . ON JOAN ’ S FACE : What ’ s she going to do ? SMASH CUT TO : 72 . INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - BEER HUT - NIGHT An impromptu ENGAGEMENT PARTY in the Beer Hut that night : — A BANNER made from PUNCH CARDS reads : “ CONGRATULATIONS ! ” — Music plays as DANCERS TWIRL in the center of the Hut . — Joan LAUGHS with her WREN FRIENDS in one corner , while in another Alan drinks beer with his team . ON JOAN AND THE GIRLS : She shows off her makeshift wire engagement ring : JOAN ’ S FRIEND ( trying her best ) ... It ’ s ... beautiful ? Joan LAUGHS . She understands . JOAN CLARKE I know it ’ s not an ordinary ring ... She looks over at Alan warmly . JOAN CLARKE ( CONT ’ D ) ... But who ever loved ordinary ? ON ALAN AND THE BOYS : They ’ re are all a bit drunk , TELLING DIRTY STORIES : HUGH ALEXANDER ... So she ’ s got it in her hands , right , and she looks up at me and says , “ I ’ m to put it in my mouth ? ” And I say , “ yes , you know . The French way. ” So she pops it in , closes her lips around the thing ... And then she starts humming the bloody Marseillaise ! The men BURST INTO LAUGHTER . Except for Alan , who looks a bit confused . PETER HILTON ( to Alan ) What about you and Joan ? Does she do it the French way ? Alan looks away , uncomfortable . HUGH ALEXANDER Soon enough , you lucky bastard . 73 . Just then , Joan comes over and throws an affectionate arm around Alan . JOAN CLARKE Care for a dance ? HUGH ALEXANDER No no , your fiancé can dance with you anytime he likes . Now it ’ s my turn . Hugh takes Joan ’ s hand , and leads her across the room . They begin to DANCE , while Peter follows , dancing with one of Joan ’ s friends . Alan and John are left alone at the table . Alan looks worried . JOHN CAIRNCROSS What ’ s the matter ? ALAN TURING ... What if I don ’ t fancy ... being with Joan in that way ? JOHN CAIRNCROSS Because you ’ re a homosexual ? Alan looks at him , surprised . JOHN CAIRNCROSS ( CONT ’ D ) I suspected . You ’ re not quite as much of an enigma as you think you are . Or as much as Enigma is . ALAN TURING Should I tell Joan ? I ’ ve had affairs . With other men . JOHN CAIRNCROSS You know , in my admittedly limited experience , women tend to be a bit touchy about accidentally marrying homosexuals . I think perhaps not spreading this information around might be in your best interest . ALAN TURING Having children , a family ... I want that with her . I do . I just don ’ t know if I can ... Pretend ... 74 . JOHN CAIRNCROSS You can ’ t tell anyone , Alan . It ’ s illegal . And Denniston is looking for any excuse he can get to put you away . ALAN TURING ... I know . JOHN CAIRNCROSS This has to stay a secret , or trust me , they ’ ll kill you for it . ON ALAN : He knows John is right . As Alan thinks , Joan comes back over and offers him her hand . JOAN CLARKE Come on , now it ’ s your turn . She leads him to the dance floor . As they START TO DANCE , chastely , sweetly , WE CUT TO : INT . SHERBORNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - ALAN ’ S ROOM - DAY - 1927 CLOSE ON A LETTER : “ I LOVE YOU ” is written on the paper . REVEAL : Young Alan sits in his dormitory room , ENCRYPTING his love letter to Christopher . Slowly , letter by letter , Alan transforms “ I LOVE YOU ” into code ... Hearing a commotion , Alan LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW : BOYS are being unloaded from a BUS at the gates , dropped off to begin the new spring term . Alan sees them all , excited : Christopher is coming back ! He STUFFS HIS ENCRYPTED LETTER IN AN ENVELOPE and RUNS OFF to EXT . SHERBORNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - FRONT GATES - MINUTES LATER Alan waits eagerly by the main gate as BOYS STREAM PAST — — Joking , horsing around — — Alan waits patiently , looking for Christopher ’ s face among the rowdy schoolboys — 75 . — Until : They ’ re all gone . Christopher never shows . Alan looks at his undelivered note , then at the empty yard before him . Where is Christopher ? Confused , Young Alan finally gives up ... ... When he runs into the PACK OF BOYS who beat him up earlier . BOY # 1 Well look . Mr. Turing is all alone . Young Alan stands frozen as they come at him , and we CUT TO : INT . MANCHESTER POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - 1951 Alan Turing sits alone in the interrogation room with his eyes closed . Detective Nock enters . DETECTIVE NOCK Cup of tea ? ALAN TURING ( eyes closed ) Thanks , no . DETECTIVE NOCK ... Mr. Turing , may I tell you a secret ? ALAN TURING I ’ m quite good with those . DETECTIVE NOCK I ’ m here to help you . Suddenly , Alan opens his eyes . ALAN TURING ( re : being in jail ) Clearly . DETECTIVE NOCK ( changing tacks ) ... Can machines think ? 76 . ALAN TURING You ’ ve read my published work . DETECTIVE NOCK What makes you say that ? ALAN TURING Because I ’ m sitting in a police station , accused of entreating a young man to touch my penis , and you ’ re asking me whether machines can think . DETECTIVE NOCK Can they ? Could machines ever think as human beings do ? ALAN TURING Most people say no . DETECTIVE NOCK You ’ re not most people . ALAN TURING The problem is that you ’ re asking a stupid question . I am ? DETECTIVE NOCK ALAN TURING Of course machines can ’ t think “ as human beings do. ” A machine is different from a human being ; hence , it would think differently . The interesting question is , just because something thinks differently from you , does that mean it ’ s not thinking ? We allow that humans have such divergences from one another . You like strawberries . I hate ice-skating . You cry at sad films . I ’ m allergic to pollen . What does it mean to have different tastes — different preferences — other than to say that our brains work differently ? That we think differently from one another ? And if we can say that about each another , why can ’ t we say the same for brains made of copper and steel ? DETECTIVE NOCK That ’ s ... This big paper you wrote ... What ’ s it called ? 77 . ALAN TURING “ The Imitation Game. ” DETECTIVE NOCK Right . That ’ s what it ’ s about ? ALAN TURING ( thinking ) ... Would you like to play ? DETECTIVE NOCK Play ? ALAN TURING The game . It ’ s a test , of sorts . For determining whether something is a machine , or a human being . DETECTIVE NOCK How do we play ? ALAN TURING There ’ s a judge , and a subject . The judge asks questions , and based on the subject ’ s answers , he determines : Who is he speaking with ? What is he speaking with ? All you have to do is ask me a question . DETECTIVE NOCK ... What did you do during the war ? ALAN TURING I worked in a radio factory . DETECTIVE NOCK What did you really do during the war ? Alan smiles — Detective Nock is smarter than he looks . ALAN TURING ... Are you paying attention ? INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 11 - NIGHT - 1942 Alan and his team — Hugh , John , Peter — anxiously stand before Alan ’ s huge machine as it CLACK CLACK CLACKS , ferociously loud . The gears are spinning , current is flowing through the wires , and the team stares at it , taking turns compulsively checking their watches . 78 . ON ALAN : This is going to work . This has to work . Suddenly ... ... DING . The chime announces the stroke of midnight . HUGH ALEXANDER Damn it ! Everyone is pissed , frustrated . Alan looks as if he ’ s about to rip his own hair out : Why won ’ t this damned thing work ? As the machine CLACKS on , oblivious , they all walk outside : EXT . BLETCHLEY PARK - NEAR HUT 11 - CONTINUOUS The team walks across Bletchley together , moving as one through the most highly secret war zone in the world . MORE SECURITY has been added throughout the park , including along the path from Hut 11 — ARMED GUARDS check IDs , which the team hands over absentmindedly . JOHN CAIRNCROSS We ’ re soon out of time . Our month ... PETER HILTON So that ’ s it then . We lost . HUGH ALEXANDER It does not matter how much we improve on it , that machine will never be able to check 159 million million million possibilities in time . ALAN TURING It ’ s searching ... It ’ s doesn ’ t know what it ’ s for ... If only we knew messages were going to just ... It searching what the say ... JOHN CAIRNCROSS If we knew what the messages were going to say , we wouldn ’ t have to decrypt them at all . ON ALAN : Maybe it was always impossible after all . 79 . INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - BEER HUT - LATER It ’ s crowded in the beer hut , even this late at night . On one side of the room , Alan , Hugh , John , and Peter are drinking . Commiserating about their fate . On the other side , Joan is drinking with her friend HELEN — a fellow WREN . ON JOAN AND HELEN : HELEN Who ’ s Alan ’ s friend ? JOAN CLARKE Hugh ? Bit of a cad , actually . HELEN So my type then ? JOAN CLARKE Here , I ’ ll introduce you . HELEN No ! Lord , engaged for a fortnight and you ’ ve already forgotten how to do this ? He ’ ll come over . JOAN CLARKE Are you sure ? HELEN Yes . I smiled at him fifteen minutes ago and haven ’ t looked at him since . ON HUGH , ALAN , JOHN , AND PETER : Hugh is looking at the girls . HUGH ALEXANDER ( re : Helen ) Who ’ s that , then ? ALAN TURING Helen ? Works with Joan in the WREN ’ s hut . PETER HILTON You do have a point about the little hats . HUGH ALEXANDER She wants me to come over . 80 . ALAN TURING How can you possibly know that ? HUGH ALEXANDER She smiled at me awhile back and hasn ’ t looked again since . ON JOAN AND HELEN : HELEN ( re : Hugh ’ s glances ) And ... Got him . JOAN CLARKE Is it odd that when I was single this game felt tedious , but now it seems just dreadfully fun ? ON THE BOYS : HUGH ALEXANDER ( re : Helen ’ s glances ) And ... Brilliant . She ’ s in . Alan , introduce me . Why me ? ALAN TURING HUGH ALEXANDER Because there is nothing like a friend ’ s engagement to make a woman want to do something she will later regret with the fiancé ’ s betterlooking chum . Hugh drags Alan across the pub to Helen and Joan . ON JOHN AND PETER : JOHN CAIRNCROSS Half crown says Alan bollockses this up entirely . PETER HILTON No bet . ON HUGH , ALAN , JOAN , AND HELEN : HUGH ALEXANDER ( to the ladies ) Alan Turing has a theory . JOAN CLARKE He has many . 81 . HUGH ALEXANDER He believes that the regulations against men and women working sideby-side are sound , because such proximity will necessarily lead to romance . ALAN TURING No I don ’ t — Hugh KICKS Alan , who shuts up . HUGH ALEXANDER — However , I disagree . You do ? HELEN HUGH ALEXANDER I think that if I were working beside a woman all day long , I could manage to appreciate her abilities and intellect without needing to take her to bed . ( to Helen ) Pardon , have we met ? HELEN I don ’ t recall . But let ’ s assume we haven ’ t . Hugh looks at Alan for an introduction : Alan is silent . Joan picks up the slack : JOAN CLARKE Helen Stewart , Hugh Alexander . HUGH ALEXANDER So who do you agree with ? Alan or myself ? HELEN Well , Alan , of course . ALAN TURING I ’ m flattered , but this is not actually — Now Joan KICKS Alan , who is still very confused . — Rubbish . HUGH ALEXANDER 82 . HELEN I work beside a man every day , and I can ’ t help but have developed a bit of a crush on him . HUGH ALEXANDER Well who is this man , so I can kick his arse ? HELEN Oh , it ’ s been chaste , you ’ ve no need to worry . We ’ ve never even met . He ’ s a German . HUGH ALEXANDER Now I really want to kill him . ALAN TURING How do you mean you work alongside a German ? HELEN Each of us intercepts messages from a specific German radio tower . So we ’ ve a counterpart on the other side , who ’ s tip-tapping out the messages . Everybody types a touch differently ; you get to know the rhythm of your counterpart . It ’ s strangely intimate . I feel as if we know each other . Pity he has a girlfriend ... But that ’ s why I disagree with you . I ’ m in love with a co-worker , of sorts , even if we ’ ve never met . HUGH ALEXANDER I ’ ll require another pint to tell you why you ’ re wrong . Let ’ s . HELEN Helen and Hugh walk away to the bar ... JOAN CLARKE ( to Alan ) That ’ s what flirting looks like . In case you were curious . But Alan is lost in thought ... Something is wrong ... ALAN TURING ( screaming ) HELEN ! ! ! 83 . Everyone in the room turns and stares at him . Joan winces . Helen and Hugh come back over . Yes , Alan ? HELEN ALAN TURING Why do you think your German counterpart has a girlfriend ? HELEN Oh , it ’ s a stupid joke , don ’ t worry about it . Tell me . ALAN TURING HELEN Each one of his messages begins with the same five letters . C-I-L-LY . So I suspect Cilly must be the name of his amore . ALAN TURING That ’ s impossible . The Germans are instructed to choose five letters at random to start every message . HELEN Well , this bloke doesn ’ t . HUGH ALEXANDER Love ’ ll make a man do strange things , I suppose . Anyhow — ALAN TURING — In this case , love just lost the Germans the whole bloody war . Alan BOLTS out of the bar — — SPILLING BEER ALL OVER HELEN — — Who CRIES OUT , and ANGRILY RUNS OFF — — Leaving Hugh and Joan standing there , confused . They share a look : What ’ s gotten into Alan ? Joan quickly RUNS OFF after Alan — — Hugh follows suit — 84 . — And John and Peter , seeing this across the room , take off after Hugh — EXT . BLETCHLEY PARK - CONTINUOUS - SEQUENCE Everyone chases Alan across Bletchley Park — — GUARDS YELL at Alan as he bypasses security checkpoints — — Guards are screaming at them , drawing guns as he and Joan barrel into Hut 8 — — Hugh and John show their IDs to the Guards , yelling back at them — — Hugh and John finally get rid of the guards and enter : INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 8 - CONTINUOUS — Joan runs into the Hut to find that Alan has grabbed a BOX OF PREVIOUSLY DECRYPTED MESSAGES — — Alan POURS those messages out all over the floor — Alan ? JOAN CLARKE — Hugh , John , and Peter enter as Alan spreads the messages out on the floor . ( Just like he did in Joan ’ s flat ! ) ALAN TURING What if Christopher doesn ’ t have to search through all the settings ? What if he only had to search the ones that produce the words we already know will be in the message ? HUGH ALEXANDER Repeated words ! Predictable words ... — They all search the messages with Alan — — Joan holds up a DECRYPT : It ’ s the same one she read earlier . JOAN CLARKE Like this ? ( reading aloud ) “ 0600 hours . Weather today is clear . Rain in the evening . Heil Hitler. ” 85 . ALAN TURING Yes ! That ’ s it ! ( looking at message ) They send a weather report at 6AM . Every day . That means there are three words we already know will be in the 6am message . “ Weather , ” obviously , and — HUGH ALEXANDER — “ Heil bloody Hitler. ” ALAN TURING Heil bloody Hitler . Joan searches through a PILE , finding : JOAN CLARKE Here ’ s the 6 o ’ clock message from this morning . Joan holds the message as they all run out to : EXT . BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 8 - CONTINUOUS Alan runs from Hut 8 to Hut 11 , the team chasing behind him . INT .

ALAN TURING — Yes . Joan , what ’ s the last 6am message ? Joan reads aloud to Alan as he enters it in : JOAN CLARKE L - H - W - A - U - Q - X - K ... They all stand back as Alan TURNS ON the machine . They watch the CLACK CLACK CLACK of Christopher as he processes the message ... — They ’ re nervous , fretting , anxiously awaiting his calculations ... ... Finally , Christopher STOPS . Silence , as a SERIES OF ROTORS on the side of Christopher snap into place , displaying a SET OF LETTERS . PETER HILTON What happened ? Did it work ? Alan SCRIBBLES down the letters ( ” EXBAO ... ” ) and they all run back to — INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 8 - CONTINUOUS Where Alan takes a DUMMY ENIGMA MACHINE , turns the machine ’ s rotors to the setting he wrote down ( ” EXBAO ... ” ) — ALAN TURING Give me a fresh message . The last one we intercepted . Peter hands Alan one from a nearby folder — — Alan starts typing one of today ’ s gibberish encrypted messages into Enigma — — As John TAKES DOWN the decoded German letters — — Hugh looks at what John is writing and TRANSLATES the German into English — HUGH ALEXANDER “ KMS Jaguar ...

BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 8 - DAWN The team has been there working all through the night . There ’ s a flurry of activity : Decoding messages , translating the decrypts , reading the information contained within . Hugh steps back for a moment to look at the product of their work : A BIG MAP ON THE WALL . ON THE MAP : It ’ s the Atlantic Ocean . Blue pins represent the Allied ships , red ones represent the Axis ships . HUGH ALEXANDER You did it . ( turns to Alan ) Bloody hell , you did it . You just defeated Nazism with a crossword puzzle . What does it feel like to do the impossible ? ON ALAN ’ S FACE : He ’ s not sure . Something is bothering him , but he can ’ t figure out what . John steps back from his work to join Hugh . 88 . JOHN CAIRNCROSS There are five people in the world who know the position of every ship in the Atlantic . They are all in this room . Now Joan joins Hugh and John in seeing the full map for the first time . JOAN CLARKE Oh my good God . HUGH ALEXANDER I don ’ t think even He has the power that we do right now . JOAN CLARKE ( getting closer to map ) There ’ s going to be an attack on a British passenger convoy . There . JOHN CAIRNCROSS You ’ re right . Those U-Boats are only twenty or thirty minutes away . JOAN CLARKE Civilians . Hundreds of them . We can save their lives . JOHN CAIRNCROSS And knock out a whole German fleet in the process . HUGH ALEXANDER I ’ ll call Denniston . Have him radio his Admirals immediately . Hugh picks up the phone — ALAN TURING ( figuring something out ) No . JOAN CLARKE Is there enough time to save them ? JOHN CAIRNCROSS Should be . If we can get a message to the passenger convoy , she can turn — Hugh DIALS — 89 . ALAN TURING ( louder ) No . No . HUGH ALEXANDER ( into phone ) — Commander Denniston ’ s office — NO . ALAN TURING HUGH ALEXANDER ( into phone ) — This is urgent , top priority — NO ! ! ! ALAN TURING Alan LEAPS ACROSS THE ROOM and GRABS THE PHONE FROM HUGH . HUGH ALEXANDER What the bloody hell ? Hugh tries to grab the phone back — — But Alan pulls away sharply . Everyone STOPS . Turns . Looks at Alan . HUGH ALEXANDER ( CONT ’ D ) Are you mad ? ALAN TURING No . No . You can ’ t call Denniston . You can ’ t tell him about the attack . JOAN CLARKE Alan , are you all right ? What ’ s going on ? JOHN CAIRNCROSS We can have air support over the passenger convoy in ten minutes . ALAN TURING No . Let the U-Boats sink the convoy . JOHN CAIRNCROSS Look , this has been a big day , maybe you ’ re going through a bit of shock — HUGH ALEXANDER — There ’ s no time for this . 90 . Hugh tries to GRAB THE PHONE from Alan — — but Alan PULLS it away and SMASHES THE PHONE AGAINST THE GROUND . Alan ! JOAN CLARKE Hugh can ’ t take it anymore — — He TAKES A SWING AT ALAN — — Who CRUMPLES AT THE BLOW ON HIS JAW — — Hugh stares down at Alan , who ’ s bleeding on the floor — — Hugh WINDS UP FOR ANOTHER PUNCH — — When Joan CATCHES HIS ARM mid-swing — — Surprised , Hugh instinctively SWINGS AT HER — — Smacking Joan hard across the face . — He ’ s stunned by what he ’ s done as she responds by PUSHING HIM INTO A TABLE — — And Hugh falls to the floor , next to Alan . Joan stands above them . JOAN CLARKE ( CONT ’ D ) ( to Hugh ) If you hurt him , you will just barely live to regret it . Silence . Just the sounds of panting . JOHN CAIRNCROSS Everyone stop . Please . Calm down . PETER HILTON The attack is in minutes . We don ’ t have time to calm down . ALAN TURING Do you know why people like violence , Hugh ? Because it feels good . ( wipes blood from his nose ) It would feel good to blow those UBoats out of the Atlantic . But sometimes we can ’ t do what feels good . We have to do what ’ s logical . 91 . JOHN CAIRNCROSS What ’ s logical ? ALAN TURING The hardest time to lie is when the other person is expecting to be lied to . JOAN CLARKE ( getting it ) Oh my God . What ? JOHN CAIRNCROSS ALAN TURING If they ’ re waiting for a lie , you can ’ t just give them one . JOAN CLARKE Oh my God . Damn it . Alan ’ s right . What ? ! ? PETER HILTON ALAN TURING What will the Germans think if we destroy those U-Boats ? PETER HILTON Nothing . They ’ ll be dead . JOHN CAIRNCROSS ( getting it ) No . No . You can ’ t be right . PETER HILTON Am I the only one who ’ s still not getting this ? ALAN TURING Suddenly our convoy veers off course and a fleet of RAF bombers magically descends on the location of a pack of U-Boats ? What will the Germans think ? Hugh ? PETER HILTON HUGH ALEXANDER ... The Germans will know we broke Enigma . JOAN CLARKE They ’ ll put a halt on radio communication by noon . ( MORE ) 92 . JOAN CLARKE ( CONT 'D ) And they ’ ll have the design of Enigma changed by the weekend . ALAN TURING Two years of work . Everything we ’ ve done here . It ’ ll all be for nothing . JOHN CAIRNCROSS There are 500 people in that convoy . Civilians . Women . Children . We ’ re about to let them die . ALAN TURING Our job wasn ’ t to save one passenger convoy . It was to win the war . HUGH ALEXANDER Our job was to break Enigma . ALAN TURING Done . Now for the hard part : keeping it a secret . Forever . Peter looks at the map ... PETER HILTON It ’ s the Carlisle . They all look at him . JOAN CLARKE What ? PETER HILTON The convoy you ’ re about to ... It ’ s ... The HMS Carlisle is one of the ships . ALAN TURING So ? PETER HILTON We can ’ t act on every piece of intelligence ? Fine . We won ’ t . Just this one . The Germans won ’ t find us out if we stop one attack . JOAN CLARKE What ’ s gotten into you , Peter ? PETER HILTON ... My brother . Phillip . He ’ s on the Carlisle . Gunnery ensign . 93 . Silence . Fuck . ALAN TURING I ’ m sorry . PETER HILTON Who the hell do you think you are ? This is my brother . My big brother . He was the only one — Look , he was there after my mum — He ’ s my big brother , alright , and you have a few minutes to call off his murder . ALAN TURING It ’ s not my fault . Peter DIVES for Alan — — But John stops him . JOHN CAIRNCROSS Alan is right . We can ’ t . PETER HILTON AND WHY THE BLOODY HELL NOT ? I am begging you . Alan . Joan . Hugh . John . Please . I am begging you . Just this once . Just one time . The Germans won ’ t get suspicious just because we stopped one attack . It ’ s one time . No one will know . I ’ m asking you . As your friend . If I mean anything to you . Please . Silence . This is the hardest thing anyone in this room has ever had to do . ALAN TURING I ’ m so sorry . PETER HILTON You ’ re not God , Alan . You don ’ t get to decide who lives and who dies . ALAN TURING Yes , we do . PETER HILTON Why ? Why ? ALAN TURING Because no one else can . 94 . INT . TRAIN - DAY Alan and Joan ride the train from Bletchley into London . They know what they have to do . EXT . TRAIN STATION - DAY Alan and Joan exit the train and walk down the platform . INT . TEA SHOP - LONDON - DAY In a quiet TEA SHOP , Alan , Joan , and Stewart Menzies sip their Twinings . Outside the GLASS WINDOWS , NURSES help WOUNDED SOLDIERS out of an AMBULANCE and into a local HOSPITAL . STEWART MENZIES ... Why are you telling me this ? ALAN TURING We need your help to keep this from the Admiralty . Army . RAF . No one can know we broke Enigma , not even Denniston . STEWART MENZIES Who is in the process of having you fired . JOAN CLARKE You ’ ll take care of that . ALAN TURING While we develop a system for determining how much intelligence to act on . Which attacks to stop , which to let through . Statistical analysis . The minimum number of actions it ’ ll take to win the war , but the maximum number we ’ re able to take before the Germans get suspicious . STEWART MENZIES You ’ re going to trust this all to statistics ? To maths ? Correct . ALAN TURING JOAN CLARKE And then MI-6 can come up with the lies we ’ ll tell everyone else . 95 . ALAN TURING We ’ ll require a believable alternate source for each piece of information we use . JOAN CLARKE A false story that exlains how we got that information , that has nothing to do with Enigma . And then you ’ ll need to leak those stories to the Germans . ALAN TURING And the rest of our military . JOAN CLARKE Can you do that ? STEWART MENZIES Maintain a conspiracy of lies through the highest levels of our government ? Yes , that sounds right up my alley . ON ALAN AND JOAN : Okay . Let ’ s do it . STEWART MENZIES ( CONT ’ D ) ( smiling ) Alan , I so rarely have cause to say this . But you are exactly the man I always hoped you would be . INT . TRAIN - DAY Alan and Joan ride the train back to Bletchley . She reaches out and puts her hand in his .

A WREN removes the first few dozen from a pile — — And hands it over to another WREN — INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 11 - SEQUENCE — In Hut 11 , the WREN gives the day ’ s first messages to Hugh , who enters them into Christopher — ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) It was like having a tap on Himmler ’ s intercom . — Christopher HUMS — — And Hugh , after a few minutes , reads the day ’ s Enigma settings on the machine ’ s read-out : “ FSOQR ” INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 8 - DAY Jack turns his Enigma machine to the day ’ s setting — “ FSOQR ” — and one by one types in the newly intercepted messages , recording the now decrypted results in a BOOKLET . On the cover , the booklet is marked : “ ULTRA. ” ALAN TURING ( V.O . ) Secrecy became the primary concern . And for some reason they trusted me . Alan organizes stacks of similar ULTRA booklets when he has trouble finding one of them — He looks up to see Peter walking nearby . ALAN TURING Peter , do you have the 9:30 decrypts — But instead of answering , Peter BUMPS HARD against Alan ’ s shoulder , scattering Alan ’ s papers to the floor . Jack looks over . Peter keeps on walking . No one helps Alan as he bends down to clean up his papers . Peter LEAVES Hut 8 without speaking a single word . 97 . ON ALAN : He ’ s kneeling down in front of John ’ s MESSY DESK , picking up papers from the floor , when his eyes come level with something on the desk ... ... It ’ s a BOOK . Buried underneath CRYPTOGRAPHIC PAPERS . Alan stares at it strangely . Something about its shape and colour look familiar ... He UNCOVERS it ... IT ’ S A BIBLE . Holy shit . There ’ s a page dog-eared . Alan opens to the page — it ’ s Matthew 7:7 . “ Seek and ye shall find ... ” ON ALAN : JOHN CAIRNCROSS IS THE SOVIET SPY . Suddenly : JOHN CAIRNCROSS ( O.S . ) Peter will come around eventually . Alan turns and stands — there ’ s John , right behind him . ON JOHN : He sees something on Alan ’ s face . Something is wrong . He looks down at the desk ... AND SEES THE UNCOVERED BIBLE . What ’ s John going to do ? Alan is terrified ... JOHN CAIRNCROSS ( CONT ’ D ) ... Jack , could you give Alan and I a moment ? Across the room , Jack looks over . Whatever is going on between Alan and John , he wants no part of it . Jack leaves . Alan is now alone with John , the Soviet spy . JOHN CAIRNCROSS ( CONT ’ D ) ... The Soviets and us , we ’ re all on the same side . What I ’ m doing will help Britain . ALAN TURING I ’ ll tell Denniston . JOHN CAIRNCROSS No you won ’ t . Because if you tell him my secret , I ’ ll tell him yours . 98 . ON ALAN : Oh God , John was the one person he trusted . JOHN CAIRNCROSS ( CONT ’ D ) Do you know what they do to homosexuals ? You ’ ll never be able to work again . Never be able to teach . Your precious machine — doubt you ’ ll ever see him again . ON ALAN : Looks down . He ’ s beaten . He puts an understanding hand on Alan ’ s shoulder . JOHN CAIRNCROSS ( CONT ’ D ) Until the history books are ready to call you a hero , sometimes you have to play the villain . And with that , John takes his bible and leaves .

He quickly moves through the flat : What happened here ? ALAN TURING ( CONT ’ D ) Joan , are you okay ? Where are you ? 99 . Runs to the back bedroom , where he finds ... ... Stewart Menzies . Calmly looking over some papers . ALAN TURING ( CONT ’ D ) Where ’ s Joan ? STEWART MENZIES Military prison . ALAN TURING What have you done ? STEWART MENZIES ( holding up papers ) Decoded Enigma intercepts . A stack of them under her nightstand . ON ALAN : Fuck . ALAN TURING I gave those to her . A year ago . When she was with the clerks I was— STEWART MENZIES — Yes yes yes , I ’ m sure . But Denniston has been looking for a Soviet spy , and he ’ s been looking for one inside Hut 8 . ALAN TURING I know who the Soviet agent is . It ’ s not Joan . Menzies looks at Alan : Who is it if not her ? ALAN TURING ( CONT ’ D ) ... I found the bible ... The spy is John Cairncross . Menzies SMILES . As if he ’ s impressed . STEWART MENZIES ... God , how I wish you ’ d been the spy . You ’ re so much better at this than he is . ALAN TURING You knew Cairncross was the spy ? STEWART MENZIES Well of course Cairncross was the bloody spy . ( MORE ) 100 . STEWART MENZIES ( CONT 'D ) I ’ ve known that since before he got to Bletchley . Why do you think I had him placed here ?

CUT BACK TO : INT . BLETCHLEY PARK - JOAN ’ S FLAT - CONTINUED ALAN TURING You placed a Soviet agent at Bletchley ? STEWART MENZIES It ’ s quite useful to be able to leak whatever we like to Stalin . QUICK CUT TO : EXT . BLETCHLEY PARK - MAIN GATE - DUSK - FLASHBACK A year earlier , John Cairncross exits the Main Gate of Bletchley carrying a SUITCASE — STEWART MENZIES ( V.O . ) Churchill is too damned paranoid .

You ’ re holding on to more secrets than the best of them . Menzies holds up the stolen decrypts . The threat is palpable . ALAN TURING You must promise to get Joan out of prison . STEWART MENZIES She ’ s at the market . She ’ ll be back in an hour . I lied . ( puts the decrypts into his pocket ) I ’ d better hold on to these . If anyone finds out about them , prison will be the least of her worries . ON ALAN : What choice does he have ? He looks down . STEWART MENZIES ( CONT ’ D ) Oh Alan . We ’ re going to have such a wonderful war together . EXT . BLETCHLEY PARK - PATHWAY NEAR HUT 8 - DAY Joan walks towards Hut 8 , showing her ID to the new GUARDS who are closely monitoring entry to the Huts . In front of Hut 8 , Alan watches her .

JOAN CLARKE You think it ’ s safe somewhere else ? ALAN TURING You need to leave , and you need to get very far away from me . JOAN CLARKE Alan . What ’ s happened ? ON ALAN : This isn ’ t working . He ’ s going to have to try a different approach . ALAN TURING ... We can ’ t be engaged anymore . Your parents will have to take you back and find you a husband elsewhere . JOAN CLARKE What is wrong with you ? ALAN TURING ... There ’ s something I have to tell you . I ’ m ... I ’ m a homosexual . JOAN CLARKE Alright . ON ALAN : What ? ALAN TURING Men , Joan . Not women . JOAN CLARKE So what ? ALAN TURING I just said — JOAN CLARKE — So what ? I had my suspicions . I always did . But we ’ re not like other people . We love each other in our own way , and we can still live the life together that we want . You won ’ t be the perfect husband ? I can promise you I harboured no intention of being the perfect wife . I ’ ll not be fixing your lamb all day awaiting your return from the office , will I ? I ’ ll work . ( MORE ) 104 . JOAN CLARKE ( CONT 'D ) You ’ ll work . We ’ ll have each other ’ s company . We ’ ll have each other ’ s minds . Sounds like a better marriage than most . Because I care for you . And you care for me . And we understand one another more than anyone else ever has . ON ALAN : He needs to get rid of her , to save her , and she is making this impossible . ALAN TURING I don ’ t . JOAN CLARKE What ? ALAN TURING Care for you . I never did . I only needed you to break Enigma . And now I ’ ve done it , so you can leave . She SLAPS HIM . JOAN CLARKE I am not going anywhere . I have spent entirely too much of my life worried about what you think of me , or what my parents think of me , or what the boys in Hut 8 or the girls in Hut 3 think , and you know I am done with it . This work is the most important thing I will ever do in my life . And no one will stop me . Least of all you . Joan turns to walk away , and then , angry , she turns back .

DETECTIVE NOCK I don ’ t know what to do now . ALAN TURING Now , Detective , you get to judge . That ’ s how the game works . I answered your questions . You know my story . That ’ s the point of the game . We are all pretending to be something . Imitating something . Someone . And we are no more , and no less , than what we can convince other people that we are . So tell me : What am I ? Am I a person ? Am I a machine ? Am I a war hero ? Am I a criminal ? DETECTIVE NOCK I can ’ t judge you . ALAN TURING Well then you ’ re no help to me at all .

The headline reads : “ CAMBRIDGE PROFESSOR SENTENCED FOR INDECENCY ” , above a photo of Alan . ON NOCK : This should make him happy . But instead he feels only empty and sick . INT . ALAN TURING ’ S HOUSE - DAY We find Alan in his study . He ’ s gained weight since last we saw him — he ’ s grown paler as well . Haggard . And the place is a horrible mess . He compares his half-built NEW MACHINE to the plans on his desk — his work progresses . Slowly . ( This is the machine we saw in the opening scene , which appears different but related to the Bletchley machine — like a newer model of the same basic concept . ) The doorbell RINGS . Alan ignores it , focused on his work . It RINGS again . Irritated , he gets up and shuffles through his house — — He ’ s walking with an odd limp , like it ’ s hard for him to move his legs normally — — And as the bell keeps RINGING insistently he reaches the front door , opening it to find : JOAN CLARKE I had to find out from the bloody newspapers .

JOAN CLARKE I would have said something . This is serious . They could send you to jail — Alan tries to move a glass of water ... ... Which he DROPS , shattering it . Damn it ... ALAN TURING JOAN CLARKE Your hands ... You ’ re twitching . ALAN TURING No I ’ m not . He is . Alan . JOAN CLARKE ALAN TURING ... It ’ s the medication . JOAN CLARKE The medication ? ALAN TURING I have to go in for weekly oestrogen treatments . At the hospital . JOAN CLARKE What are you talking about ? ALAN TURING The judge gave me a choice . Prison . Or “ hormonal therapy. ” JOAN CLARKE Oh my god . Oh my god . That ’ s — ALAN TURING — Chemical castration . Yes . To cure my homosexual predilections . Of course I chose that . I wouldn ’ t be able to work from prison . Joan is HORRIFIED . 113 . ALAN TURING ( CONT ’ D ) Well how would I even have got parts in jail ? It just makes no sense . JOAN CLARKE All right . This is what we ’ re going to do . I ’ m going to speak to your doctors . I ’ m going to speak to your lawyer . We ’ re going to find a way out of this . No . ALAN TURING JOAN CLARKE You are not thinking clearly . There are a million chemicals flowing through your brain . This treatment— ALAN TURING — I ’ m fine . JOAN CLARKE Please let me help you . ALAN TURING I don ’ t need your help . JOAN CLARKE You do not have to do this all alone . ALAN TURING Alone ? I ’ m not alone . I never have been . He looks lovingly at his machine — at Christopher . ALAN TURING ( CONT ’ D ) ... Christopher has got so smart . If I stop the treatment , they ’ ll take him away from me . You can ’ t let them do that . You can ’ t . Don ’ t let them leave me alone .

Looking at his machine , Alan starts to have a small PANIC ATTACK — he ’ s getting more emotional , twitching more , getting teary — the hormones are flowing through him . JOAN CLARKE ( re : Alan ’ s freak out ) Here , it ’ s alright . It ’ s alright . Sit down . 114 . She sits him in a chair , trying to contain his hyperventilating . Alan , embarrassed at this uncontrollable display , tries to play it off , but of course he can ’ t stop it . With her hand on his shoulder , he notices her WEDDING RING . ALAN TURING ( trying to seem normal ) ... It ’ s a much nicer ring than the one I got you . JOAN CLARKE His name is Jock . We work together in Eastcote . He ’ s gotten me into coin collecting . Can you believe it ? Joan looks around the room for a tea cup , a glass of water , anything that isn ’ t mouldy she can have him sip from . She sees the newspaper she brought in , grabs it . JOAN CLARKE ( CONT ’ D ) Do you want to do a crossword ? For old times ’ sake . It ’ ll only take five minutes . Or in your case , six . She tries to get him to smile at her joke . Joan opens the paper to a PUZZLE . Alan looks down at it . His fingers twitch . He stares at the puzzle , confused . He doesn ’ t know how to do it . Alan moves his hand away from the puzzle . ALAN TURING ... Perhaps later . The treatment has wrecked his brain so badly that he can ’ t do crossword puzzles anymore . Joan watches and her heart utterly breaks . ON JOAN : He ’ s gone forever .

ALAN TURING ( CONT ’ D ) You got what you wanted , didn ’ t you ? Work . A husband . A normal life . She looks at him quietly for a moment . JOAN CLARKE But no one normal could have done this . ( gestures to Christopher ) This morning I took a train through a city that would not exist if it wasn ’ t for you . I bought a ticket from a man who would likely be dead if it wasn ’ t for you . I read up on my work , a whole field of scientific inquiry that only exists because of you . If you wish you could have been ‘ normal ’ , I can promise you , I do not . The world is an infinitely better place precisely because you weren ’ t . ALAN TURING Is that what you think ? JOAN CLARKE ...

To its lecture room and classes came students from all over the world and among them was a young girl . She was poor . She was beautiful . She had left her homeland and family and here in Paris , she was alone haunted by dreams and invincibly eager To go out alone into space . Go out alone . In one hundred years one hundred students but when it is time for you to think you , too , will be alone like the author of this equation like Newton let us say your Galileo . Probably will not be your good fortune to reach the sky to catch the stars in your fingertips . To catch a star in your fingertips . But this you can share with them . You can learn to be alone with nature with the ray of light piece of earth drop of rain you can become aware that the earth 's swirling about the sun at the rate of Aware that the ... What ... what 's that ? You are feeling better ? Sit . Sit still a moment . You fainted . I ... Im sorry I interrupted the lecture so stupidly . You can get the notes from some other students . Your name is Marie Scholoscka ? Yes . You are working in two master degrees . One in physics and one in mathematics . You passed first in the ... mathematical examination last year . What did you have to eat today ? Eat ? Yes , eat . I do n't remember . I have some lunch . What did you have ? Salmon . All sort of things . You have a pleasant room ? Yes , monsieur . Good . What time did you have that coat Come along . Come along , please . This is rather unusual to have no friends here in Paris . I have little time for friends . Usually , there 's some young men . I 'm interested in physics and mathematics . Yes , so am I . Yet , I have a wife and a home a daughter and two granddaughters I 'm afraid I will not be up to that . Your desire is to go back to Poland and teach ? Yes . Your parents are still in Warsaw My father is a physics professor He is old . When I have my degrees I shall go back and live with him . You love Poland . Oh , yes . I love Poland . Physics and mathematics and Poland . Yes . Eat your soup . Thank you very much . The Society of Natural Industry has asked me to recommend someone to make a study of the magnetic property of rare steel . I would be glad to recommend you if you wish . There would be some cumbersome costs I do n't know exactly what . Oh , it would n't matter . Really it would n't . I would be so grateful . Of course , that our cumbersome equipment too cumbersome for our laboratories , I 'm afraid . However , I know a scientist of great merit who works in the school of physics and chemistry . Perhaps he might have recommendation available . Come and have tea Sunday with my wife and me . I will ask him to come , too . You probably know his name . It is Pierre Curie . Oh , thank you so much . Thank you You have been very kind . Not at all . Not at all . Good bye then . Until Sunday . Sunday . Good night . Good night . To catch a star at your fingertips . Ah . Madame Poirot . You are Mdme . Scholoscka . I knew it . Yes . We 've been waiting for you . My husband has told me all about you . Ah . Professor Curie . How nice ? Madame . You two had met ? Have not had the honor in the hallway . This is Mdme . Marie Scholoscka . professor Pierre Curie . My husband said you have no friends in Paris but that 's impossible , child We must remedy that . Please Professor ... Come in . Come in . I 'm sure you know everyone here . In Paris you must have many friends . I want you to meet all these charming ... May I introduce you to ... This is Mdme . Scholoscka ... What time ? Always hard to meet , gentlemen . Dr. Curie Good afternoon . I had no idea that it was going to be a party . No ... I believe you , monsieur . They 're pulling up suddenly these parties out of the goodness of women 's hearts . My wife wishes the young student of mine to make many friends . Well , I ... I 'm very bad at parties . It 's impossible for me to focus . My mind wo n't follow the most simple thought . Oh , I beg your pardon . You are quite alright . Maybe I 'll come back some other day . No ... I want to talk to you about this student of mine . Perhaps we can find a quiet corner where we can talk . Of course . Of course . And as this student has very little money , and is I believe , extremely talented I thought you might have room available at physics and chemistry . Oh , I should be very glad . Unfortunately at the moment we are extremely crowded ourselves . In that case ... However , my workroom is quite large . I would hesitate to ask you to share your own laboratory ... I have shared it with students before . You have ? Yes , and some of them were very quiet and pleasant . On the other hand one fellow was most troublesome . He used to whistle constantly . Well , I can assure you that this student is very serious . Then I should be very happy . I think you will find that she is very sincere . She ? Oh , my God . These are my granddaughters . Excuse me . But ... Mademoiselle . Mademoiselle . Bon Appetit . A coffee ? Yes , thank you . Tea . That 's coffee . That 's coffee , too . Oh . Please sit down , everybody . Sit down . Wait a moment . Come along ... children . It 's time for your performance . Would you excuse them , Dr. Curie . They are going to play the piano . Come along ... There they are . This is the student of whom we were speaking . Mme . Scholoscka . Dr. Pierre Curie . We have already met . Dr. Curie is gracious in consenting for you to work in his laboratory I am very grateful . Of course , I have no idea that is ... Would you sit down , Madame ? Oh , would you please excuse me . I feel my grandchildren are about to entertain . Would you care for tea ? Thank you . I 've just had some . It 's coffee . I appreciate very deeply Dr. Curie the privilege of working in your laboratory . Playing incredibly badly do n't you think ? Very badly , Dr. Curie . Of course , I 'm no judge . Professor Poirot is an excellent scientist . Oh , good morning , Dr. Curie . Good morning , David . The furnace is taken down and I 'm beginning to set up for room temperature readings . I have the sulphates all ready for you . Thank you . No one has arrived yet ? Here at the laboratory ? Yes . No , sir . Are you expecting someone ? Well , a pupil of Dr. Poirot who 's going to do some work here for a short time . Yes , sir . Her name is Marie Sc ... Funny , I was introduced to her twice . Scholoscka . She 's a girl . I did n't find out in time . Always the continuous struggle against woman , David When we wish to give all our thoughts to some work which is strangest to humanity we always have to struggle against woman . Yes , sir . And women scientists are particularly unattractive I find , sir Women 's love in life is the living of it . In the world of abstract research she 's a danger , destruction . She 's a natural enemy of science There 's no doubt of it , sir . Woman and science are incompatible . Woman of genius are rare . No true scientist can have anything with women . No , sir . Anyway , David , put her over there in that far corner . Yes , sir . And if you can without being rude inform her how important silence is to laboratory work . I do hope she does n't whistle . Oh , David . Would you mind going to the storeroom upstairs and see if there 's a magnetometer . She 'll need one for her experiments . Oh , yes . I ... I 'm very sorry , sir . I beg your pardon are you looking for something ? Yes . I 'm looking for Dr. Curie 's laboratory . You 're here . But you 're not ... I mean you ca n't be ... Excuse me , please . No . You do n't understand . You see I 'm Dr. Curie 's assistant . Oh ... then you can direct me . Oh , I certainly can . Certainly can . Oh , just this way . Thank you . What do you think of that ? I run into you the first thing . You know , Dr. Curie has asked me look out for you . Be sure to have everything you want so I 'll just take everything into my own hands . Oh , here we are . Here she is , Dr. Curie . Run straight into her the first day . Oh . Good morning , Mademoiselle . Good morning , Dr. Curie . This time we met in rather a less rude atmosphere . Yes . Well that 's just as it should be . People interested in work should be left alone . You have met my assistant ? Yes . I do n't think I quite caught his name . David . David Lagroue . I 'm sure that David will see that you 're properly installed . Thank you , Dr. Curie . I appreciate this chance more than I can say . Not at all Not at all , Mademoiselle and I do hope you 'll be quite comfortable . Over this way . We picked out a specially nice place for you right over here . You 're going to have this far corner all to yourself . Of course we would have it fixed up for you had we known sooner that you were coming but we 'll take care of that right away . How do you think this is going to suit you ? Oh . It is excellent . I understand you 're a pupil of Professor Poirot 's ? Yes . I 've studied with him , too . Wonderful is n't he ? Yes , he is . Oh , I 'll give you a little more light . Please do n't bother . Oh , Dr. Curie wants you to be comfortable . I 'm sorry , Dr. Curie . Here 's a paper and pencil . You can make out a list for all the things you need , and I 'll go and see if I can get a magnetometer for you . Oh , I can take my coat off ? Oh . It 's always the way you should . Your hat ? I 'll hide it up at the cupboard for you I 'm sorry , Dr. Curie . Let me help you . Thank you . You know my office is just upstairs . I hope you won't hesitate to call on me if I can be of any assistance . You 're very kind . You sure everything 's alright ? Quite . Thank you . Not at all . If there is anything you 'd like to know about our equipment I 'd be glad to explain it to you I want to give you some advice on where to eat around here . There 's a very nice little restaurant down ... Really , monsieur . I do n't think we should talk . Why are you whispering ? I just think you ought to know where to go . Yes , but I ... I 'll take you there later . That 's the best way and It 's too trouble . Oh , no trouble at all . I 'll come back for you . Good evening , Mademoiselle . Good evening , Dr. Curie . Miserable evening , has n't it ? Yes , is n't it . Oh , by the way did David get you the telescope scale you asked for last week Oh , yes . Thank you very much . He finally look into it . Good ... Well , good evening . But you have no umbrella Mademoiselle No , I have n't , Dr. Curie . I 'm sorry . I did n't realize . Perhaps I can help you . Oh , I do n't want to trouble you . Allow me . No trouble at all . No trouble at all . Thank you . You 're very kind . Not at all , Mademoiselle . May I ask you another question Dr. Curie in the same connection ? It 's a simple matter , perhaps but it puzzles me . Yes , Mademoiselle ? In the semetry L sub-Q and two L sub-Q you include only those rotations which are integral multiples of two Pi L Q . But two times K over Q exclude the identity transformation if K is not an integer . Yes . For final case , I guess . But in a limited L sub infinity a difficult seems to arise . I do n't see why it's quite straightforward . Well , if you consider the matter rigorously ... Hmm . I have to look into that . This is where I lived . Good bye and thank you . Of course ... Oh , good bye , mademoiselle . And may I say your conversation is very simplely Thank you . It 's an extremely dawning hypothesis . Good morning , Mademoiselle . Good morning , Dr. Curie . I 'm a little late this morning . I have to stop in at my publishers . Oh . To Mme . Scholoscka my respect and friendship of honor ... friendship of honor . My book . Oh , it 's lovely . One of the first copy just off the press . On semitry and physical phenomena Semitry of Electric Field and of Magnetic Field by Pierre curie . That 's something to be proud of . I thought perhaps you might like a copy . Oh , I would very much . Well , it 's yours . It 's yours Mademoiselle . Oh , thank you . Not at all . I 've inscribed the book for you mademoiselle on the ply leaf . I believe that 's the usual procedure . I 'm very flattered . Not at all ... Come in . Oh , Dr. Becquerel . I hope I 'm not intruding Dr. Curie . But could you step over my laboratory with me ? I think I 've happened on something of great interest . Why ? What is it ? Are you too busy to ... ? Oh , no ... Not at all . I 'll come at once . Oh , are n't you coming Mademoiselle ? Well , if I may ? You do n't mind ... No . No . I 'll be delighted . I came upon it quite by accident I think you 'll agree that it is very extraordinary ... What is this thing ... Well , what did you see ? You have taken the picture of a key apparently . Yes , the picture of a key . But that picture of a key was taken ... in a very extraordinary manner . The picture of that key was taken in complete and total darkness without light of any kind . But , how was that possible ? Some months ago I had the idea that perhaps certain rocks and minerals might store applied energy from the sun that if I left the rocks and minerals in the sun long enough they might absorbed some of its rays and then later , give them out . So I make some photographic experiments You see these rocks they 're all different kinds of minerals I labeled them as you see and left them outside in the sun for several hours . Then I put them in this drawer on photographic plates like this and then I waited to see if they would give out any sunlight they might have absorbed . I see . And your experiment was a success . To the contrary , my experiment was a complete failure . Not one of the rocks I have exposed to the sun affected the plates in anyway . See , there they are . They 're all black every one of them . Then how did you explain ... Now , look at this one , please . That has been exposed am I right ? Light has reached Oh , yes . That has been exposed . This plate was lying in this drawer quite by accident . I did n't even know it was there . It 's the drawer that I keep some of my specimens in . And when I was putting my rocks back into the drawer one of them must have fallen on this plate without my knowing it . I discovered it yesterday . This is the rock that I have not yet exposed to the sun it 's a piece of mineral called pitch blende . To be sure there could be no mistake last night I myself hide in this room in complete darkness . Took this rock , which had never been exposed to the sun and placed it on a photographic plate . I put this metal key between the stone and the plate like this so that it would be photographed if any light rays came from the stone . Half hour ago I developed the plate . This is the result . You mean , then , that ... there is something about that rock that gives off rays of its own . Rays powerful enough to go through black paper and affect this photographic plate . That , Monsieur , must be so . Incredible . It is incredible . It 's as if they were a piece of the sun locked up in here . Strange . Very strange . What could it be ? What could be the nature of radiation ? What could be the origin of it ? Perhaps we shall never know . It was very kind of you to take me to Dr. Becquerel 's laboratory . Not at all ... Dr. Curie I want to thank you also for allowing me to do my experiments here in your laboratory . I could n't have done this if it weren't for Natural Science Industry for allowing me of your kindness . You finished that already ? Yes , I had to do it quickly because I should not have much time from now on to come to the laboratory . Why ? What do you mean ? From now on , I shall spend most of my time studying . My examination 's coming up in less than two weeks , you know . So soon ? I have n't realized . Yes . I have been here six months . It 's the middle of June . The term is nearly over . How fast it goes . Yes . You know a short time ago that tree was a skeleton . I always used to look forward to my summer in my country but I 'm only there at stray moments now when I go to visit my parents . They have this small place outside of Paris at Sol . I used to take long walks towards the woods there with my brother , Jacques . So nice to be walking in the country . My father loves to walk . Your father ? Is he here in Paris ? Oh , no . In Warsaw but we get out of the city now and then . Warsaw . But you 're not thinking going to Warsaw . Of course . But when ? As soon as I finished my examinations . But for how long ? Why for ... Why , Dr. Curie . You forget that if I passed my examinations I 'm going back to Poland to teach . Well , I knew that ... wish I knew when we first came , but everything is changed now . You are making experiments of your own I know it . I shall miss Paris , too . But this is absurd , fantastic . Why , it never occurred to me . Oh , I ... I have n't planned on this at all . How could you dream of doing such a thing abandoning science when your making such progress . My father is getting old . He misses me . If you stay on in Poland you ca n't possibly go on with your studies . Anyone can teach but you can do more much more . You have a talent a definite talent and it 's your duty to use it . We 've so much to be done so much to that 's still undreamed of . Oh , Mademoiselle . I beg you to reconsider . Why , that 's very kind of you Dr. Curie I 'm really flattered . I 'm afraid I ca n't give up the entire plan that I have had for so long . I thought , of course , you knew . I do not understand how anyone with a scientific mind can entertain the thought of abandoning science . I know . But there are other things that are important , too . Dr. Curie ? Yes , Mademoiselle . I 've been meaning to ask you . I supposed you would n't care to attend my graduation ? Well , I should enjoy very much seeing you get your degree but , well , I have , ah ... there 's such a crowd always . Of course ... I understand perfectly . I feel exactly the same way myself . Well I should be coming in again of course to see to a few things Good bye , Dr. Curie . Good bye , Mademoiselle . We may well expect to hear again and again . It will always be interested for you to look back and try to recall the personality of ... your classmate who have won faith . Above all it 's the mother of learning And her children come through all the corners of the world . They come , they are nourished and then they returned to their homeland to impart what they have instilled to others . Pride is not deflated by what they take away . The whole world is in fact enriched by what they learned . And am proud in particular gained more than she gives to the very earnest students . Professor Constance , chairman of the committee on scholarship has gone over all the awards and will read the name of the successful candidates . It is my pleasure to introduce Professor Constance . The names of those who have been awarded degrees will be read in the order of merit . For the degree the master of physics . First ... Marie Scholoscka . Hello , Dr. Curie . Oh , hello , David . Is n't she wonderful ? First place in physics . Did you know we have that all that time in the laboratory ? Yes . It 's very gratifying . Here she was bright ... You have n't seen any of Mmde . Scholoscka , have you , David ? Yes , I saw her . Had a nice talk with her . Congratulated her and everything . She went straight home . Had some packing to do . Packing ? Well , she 's leaving for Poland on Tuesday . Oh . Good bye , Dr. Curie . Oh . Awfully glad I run into you . Good bye , David . Ah ! Dr. Curie . How do you do , Professor ? Lovely , was n't it ? Packing . Yes ... Was n't it lovely ? Come in ... Dr. Curie . How do you do ? I missed you at the Graduation Exercises . I looked all over for you . You were there ? Yes . Then you heard . Yes . My congratulation Mademoiselle . Thank you . You know , I was ... never dreamed that I would ... I was even afraid that I might may not ... Oh , I 'm glad you were able to go . Wo n't you sit down ? Thank you I met David and he told me that you were leaving Poland on Tuesday Yes . I see . Then you have n't reconsider Mademoiselle . I 'm afraid not . Of course . Of course . Perhaps you might have . You were packing ? Yes . Oh , yes ... naturally . Well , then ... since you are leaving so soon on Tuesday I presume there 'd be no time for something I had in mind , that is ... my father ... He is a doctor , you know . He is very short only , you know . but intelligent . And my mother is quite gay . I think you 'd enjoy knowing both of them . But of course that would be impossible because you 'd be busy packing and doing one thing or another . I had meant to ask you down before but it slipped my mind . Still , I thought it would be nice for you to take away with you some of Paris ' countryside since we were speaking of the country the last time I saw you that perhaps you might like to come with me to spend the weekend there . It 's not far but still it 's impossible I see , because , I said before you 'd be busy packing and preparing for your journey . Yes , the idea 's preposterous on the face of it . The idea is not preposterous at all . I should like to come very much . You would ? Yes . Thank you . Well , then . Well , then . I hate that girl . Eugene . I still hate that girl . What do you do in Poland , anyway ? Spend all your time at this stupid game You must not mind my husband . He never shouts at anyone unless he likes them . That 's what I thought . He had been shouting at me all my life . Well , what are looking so gloomy about , Pierre . It 's your shot . Ah , yes . Excuse me . I heard you 're going to Poland on Tuesday . Say , Monsieur . Excellent country , Poland . Thank you . Of course , he has n't been there . You do n't have to be there to know it 's an excellent country . Well , what are you waiting for . Hit it . Hit it . Well , I dare say it 's the best thing you can do . You can go on with your studies there . Of course , not with a degree that you could get here , but you will do well whatever it is . Thank you , Madame . I 'm not paying you compliments . I 'm only telling you what I see in your face . It 's all there in people 's faces . Look at my husband . A good man and a good doctor . Look at Pierre . A poet , but a poet with brains . A poet in the laboratory . Look at me , fat and foolish but quite a good old soul . It 's true . Why should I mind . Look at Monsieur and me . Mitchell there and young Master Mitchell . We 'll let them pass . But then , look at yours . Stubborn , determined , abstinent and of course , intelligent . And then , there 's something else that I ca n't quite give a name to . Fiery , is it ? No ... Flame-like . That 's a little nearer . Flame-like then . Something like a flame . Once I 'm sure I won and what with that strike of yours supposed I get out of it . You 're not paying attention . It 's no credit beating anyone who does not pay attention . Why , I tried to , Father . Then you 're just plain stupid . Oh . Leave him alone . No , sir . That boy has got to learn to concentrate . He 'll never get anywhere if he does n't concentrate . Did you ever hear the fundamental law of physics , known oddly enough as Curie 's Law Sheer luck . I do n't know how Pierre ever stumbled on to it . Oh , do be quiet , Eugene . Croquet always makes me thirsty . Want to drink ? Thank you , Father . Yes , that croquet always makes me thirsty . Yes , it stirs up the thirst in a man . Nothing like a good drink of lemonade after a fast game of croquet do n't you think so , Pierre . There . I think you 'll be comfortable here . I 'm sure I will . This is Jacques ' room when he was home Pierre 's brother , you know . Oh , there he is . Where . Oh , that . That 's Pierre . Oh , no . Really ? The other two are doctors of course . Crazy looking group . I think it 's charming . Well . I hope you rest well . Thank you . And thank you for the lovely day . I 'd been very happy and ... You 're very welcome , my dear . If you care to postpone your travel to Poland we 'd love to have you stay with us for time . It is very kind of you . I like very much to stay but I 've already written to my father and he 'd be expecting me . It 's no use , Mother , to talk Mdme . Scholoscka of staying on in Paris It seems that she 's determined to return to Poland , and apparently as far as she is concerned science is to be forgotten . I did try to explain to you why I have to return to Poland . I thought you 've understood . I do understand and I 'm sorry . Well , good night , my dear . Good night , Madame Curie . Good night , Mademoiselle . Pierre , you shouldn't have spoken to her like that . She 's a very obstinate girl Mother . After all , Poland is her home . What 's that ? I 'm just saying to Mother she is a very obstinate girl . Hmm , stubborn . Exactly . That 's what I mean . Stubborn as they come . Saw that the first minute I clap her eyes on her . Wo n't listen to reason . Closes her mind like a clam . Well , let 's go to bed . Good night , Mother . Good night , son . Good night , Father . Good night , Pierre . She 's so intelligent about other things Good night . Blind as a bat . Who ? Your son . Mdme . Scholoscka ... What is it ? What 's happened ? Is anything wrong ? Dr. Curie . I find it impossible for you to leave Paris . But what ? Please . I must talk to you . I found myself in a very peculiar position . During these past two weeks when you haven't been to the laboratory I found everything very confusing It 's impossible to do my work . In short , I find it impossible to go on without you . But now , suddenly ... something has become very clear to me . I am helpful to you in the laboratory , am I not ? Am I not ? Did n't you say that ? Yes , of course . A few times , I 've been able to give you suggestions which you 've found valuable Of course . Well , then , now . Where as I was inclined to be nervous and impatient you were quite the opposite . You have a clear mind you were tenacious you would never give up . It 's an excellent combination . I might compare it with the chemical formula NACI Sodium Chloride . It 's a stable necessary compound . So if we marry on this basis our marriage would always be the same . The temperature would be the same the composition would be the same There would be no destruction no fluctuation none of the uncertainties and emotions of love . But ... I know how you feel about love about men I mean and I respect that feeling . It 's also my own conviction . For the scientist there is no time for love . I always believe science and marriage to be incompatible but it 's stupid to believe in generalization . In our case , it would be a wonderful collaboration . A wonderful collaboration . Do n't you feel that ? I feel that . And as for your father from what you 've said I 'm sure he would applaud such a collaboration . He might . And as for Poland what little good you could make there , you could make up here ten fold on your own ground science . What do you think I should do ? It would be a very fine thing I believe to pass our lives together with our common scientific dream to work together constantly in our search and any discovery that we should make no matter how small would deepen the friendship that we already have for each other and increase the respect that we mutually feel . I can imagine no respect or friendship greater than I have for you now . I can imagine no future so full of promise than the one you offer . Then I suggest that you stay on in Paris with me . I think you are right . I should like to stay in Paris very much . Thank you . We are engaged . Engaged ? I 'm sorry . Oh , Pierre . I 'm so happy . Oh . So very happy . And I 'm , too , my boy . Very happy Thank you , Mother . Thank you , Father . Oh , Pierre . I am so glad . Good night , Mother . Good night , father . Good night , my boy . Good night . Good night . Good night . Quiet , please ... Chaplain . Quiet , please . Now , look right here , please and hold absolutely still until I count to ten . Still . One and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight and nine and ten . How I wish you happiness Mme . Curie . Oh , David . Thank you . You 're the first one who 's called me that . Good bye , Mme . Curie and bon voyage . Thank you , mademoiselle . Good bye , my dear Marie . Oh , Father dear . Good bye . Oh , congratulations , lad . Thank you . Thank you . Congratulations . Thank you , David . Bye . Bye . Excuse me . Now , where can I put this chicken ? Mother we do n't need anymore food . We 're not going at the jungle . Good gracious what 's this , Pierre ? What do you want the science book on your honeymoon ? We want to read them , Mother . Well , this is the last straw . Mother , we want those books . The chicken will do you fine I assure you . Science books on your honeymoon ! My boy , good bye . Good bye . Ready , Marie ? Here they go ... You 're very lovely , Marie . Thank you , Pierre . Music is lovely , is n't it ? Yes . Thank you . Pierre . Yes . Would you hate to get back ? In a way , although I have a lot of work that I must do . What should I work on , Pierre ? What subject should I choose for my doctors degree ? Is there anything that particularly interests you ? Oh , yes . Yes , a number of things but ... What is it ? Why did you stop ? Oh , nothing . It 's just an idea that went through my mind . Well , what was it ? Do you remember that Professor Becquerel showed us that rock The pitch blende and the plate he exposed to it ? Yes . You know , Pierre . I ca n't get that out of my mind . Really ? Why ? I know it 's true that the rays give ... not by something in the pitch blende I ca n't get over the feeling that there 's more to it than that that there 's something else something beyond Becquerel 's explanation . I do n't quite understand . Well , what are these rays that given off and why are they being given off . It 's an accepted principle in science that nothing can go on forever without running dull , is n't it ? Yes . I mean , the clock will run dull if it is n't wound . Afire would burn out if it 's not replenished . Life will die if it is inflate . Yet in these rocks which are embedded in the middle of the earth millions of years never seen the sun Rays are constantly given off more all by themselves . What is this energy ? Where does it come from ? I supposed I 'm being very foolish . Some of the greatest achievements in science come to the same type of foolishness . When an explanation is given of something and every one believes it there may be one person somewhere who ca n't quite accept it , who instinctively says I 'm not sure that this is sufficient explanation . Maybe something beyond this . It 's that kind of foolishness , Marie . Well , I 'm not that person I 'm sure . How do you know ? Perhaps you are Perhaps Dr. Becquerel has only set the gate a jar . Maybe a long and unexplored road ahead I would n't even know how to start Pierre . I would n't know what to do . I 'm very glad we 're married to each other , Pierre . Darling . Hello , Marie . My class kept me the day with the most stupid questions . Thought I would never get away . Just tonight when we 're having guests . I have a terrible problem . I hope I got the things you wanted me to get . I lost the slip that I made the notes on and I could n't remember whether there was turnips or carrots , so I got both . Mother likes carrots and Father likes turnips . And here 's some flowers for the cook . Thank you , Pierre . What 's the matter , Marie ? Oh , Pierre . I 'm so discouraged . Looks like this method of mine is all wrong . I wonder if I 'm trying something beyond me . What is it exactly that 's wrong ? I do n't know . My measurements . they do n't mean anything . I know I must be making mistakes some where ... but I do n't know where it is . I checked them and I rechecked them two hundred times . Maybe the electrometer is not working right . That 's what I 'm afraid of . I wish you 'd examine it for me Pierre I 'll go over it tomorrow . Let 's forget it tonight . Let 's not talk , not even think the laboratory Promise ? I promise . Well , Pierre . What is it ? Marie , about those measurements . Do you think anything could have happened to change the capacity of the electrometer ? Were n't we suppose to forget the laboratory tonight ? Oh . I forgot . I 'm sorry . No more ... Im terribly sorry . Here they are . Where 's my coat ? Here we are . Hello , dear . Pierre . Mother . I smell turnips . We got carrots for you . Oh , how sweet of you . Oh , I brought you some of my new plum jelly . Thank you , Mother . She made it but I brought it . Ah , thank you , Father . Let me have your things . Your coat , Father ? Yeah . You 're not treating her right , Pierre . She looks pinkish . Oh , it 's silly . Why you look lovely , dear . Just the same , she 's too thin . And I say a woman without a child is a parasite . She feeds on life but is not willing to give life in return . What is being her excuse to have life . Why would she ever born ? She 's a blood sucker . Now , do n't call names , George . Are you listening to me ? Of course . A woman without a child is a blood sucker . We did n't mean you , my dear . Oh , yes . She 's just the one I did mean . But I 'm going to have a child . When ? Soon , I hope . Oh , my dear . Marie . Yes , dear . Look who 's going to say something at last . Are you sure the insulation is dry ? Yes , Pierre . He 's getting quite chatty lately is n't he ? Do n't bother them . They 're thinking of something . I do n't believe it . Did you check the ground connection ? I do n't know . I thought you gave it to me in good order . Well , sometimes it work loose and you do n't notice it . Pierre , that could be possible could n't it ? Yes . Yes , of course . The thing we must do is to check that line completely from one end to the other . In that case my measurements may be correct . Yes . Then all these months of work could n't have been wrong after all . That 's right . Pierre , that 's it . That must be it ... Yes , that must be it . Alright . Alright . Go ahead and check it . Father , it 's just that , well Marie has so many setbacks with her work . That 's alright . Do n't stop doing ... Please . Go ahead . It 's just that I 've been waiting for so many months . It 's alright , my dear . I hope you wo n't mind if I stay long enough to finish my coffee . Please do and we 'll try to get back before you go . Thank you , my boy . Thank you . Good bye . You know , sometimes that son of yours is not quite all right . Nice having dinner with you . You know , I 'll never come to this house but for the sake ... It 's Alright , George . It happens every time . Well ? It 's alright . Nothing wrong with it . I was wrong . I was sure we 've found it . Well ... I do n't know . I 'm sorry . You tested all of the elements . you 're sure of that , Marie ? Yes , I 'm positive , Pierre . And you found that only two of them ... uranium and thorium gave off rays . That 's right . Then you measured the uranium and thorium in the pitch blende ore. And that 's when I run into trouble . The pitch blende has more radioactivity than I can explained by the amount of uranium and thorium had in it . Would you like to show me how you make your measurements Marie ? You would n't mind ? Of course not . Alright . Here is what I 've done so many times that I lost count . Here is crude pitch blende . Now we know that the rays came from the uranium and thorium that are in this pitch blende . Those two elements give off the rays . Correct . I put the pitch blende in this mortar . Has the mortar always been clean ? Always and grinded up . Here is the ground pitch blende throw in the uranium and thorium in it I also fill a disk level full . Just like what I 've done every time . Then I placed it in the electrometer . And I close the case so there is no draft . Good . I charged the electrometer . Now I will find out how much energy to raise in the pitch blende they have is it right ? Right . Start . Ready . Read . Eight . Eight . Same reading as I always had . This pitch blende with the uranium and the thorium still in it comes to eight . Now , here is pure uranium I strike it in the same amount of pitch blende . This is exactly the same case close the case charged the electrometer Now , we will find out how much energy the rays in the uranium have . Right . Ready . Read . Two , same as always . Done nothing wrong so far . Not that I can see . We know then that ... the pitch blende with the uranium and thorium in it comes to eight and that the uranium alone reads two . I am going to test the thorium . From the same amount of pitch blende ? Of course , and put in exactly the same case close the case charged the electrometer . Now we find out how much energy the rays in thorium have ? Right . Ready . Read . Two I do n't understand . There must be a mistake . When the uranium and thoarum are in the pitch blende the reading is eight . But individually they only total four . Have you checked all the other elements in the pitch blende ? I checked every elements . There is no the result . Every elements in existence . Uranium and thorium are the only elements that give off rays . Why do they give off twice as much when they are in the pitch blende as they do as they were tested separately ? Where are those four missing points ? That is what I do n't understand . I do n't understand . You make the chemical analysis of what is content in the pitch blende , did n't you ? Of course . Could I see it ? Yes . Uranium oxide - 75 % Chlorium Oxide - 13 % Lead sulfide - 3 % Silicon dioxide - 2 % Calcium oxide - 3 % Barium oxide - 2 % Iron oxide - 1 % Magnesium oxide - 1/990 % other extraneous elements Pierre Yes ? Our universe is composed of definitely known substances is n't it ? Elements are fixed forever in earth unchanging we know that , do n't we ? All of our scientist based on that All of our science is based on that . Go on In the beginning man used to think that the world have only of four elements , earth , air , fire and water . They thought that everything in their universe could be made out of those . Yes . Go on . But They were wrong , were n't they ? They were wrong . Now we know that there are 78 elements The elements over there on the shelves and we believe that there are some elements still unknown but we assume that ... these missing elements have the same character as those we know already . That is right Pierre What if there is a kind of matter in the world we never even dream of ? What would that mean ? Marie , that would mean that our whole conception of the nature of matter would have to be changed . It is cold in here . Tell me what you are thinking . I do n't quite dare . Go on and say it now matter how crazy it sounds . What if we did not make a mistake in our measurement ? What if the conception of science is wrong ? What if there exists a matter that is not in earth but alive , dynamic ? Do we dare think that our four missing points these strange power is of 1/1000 % ? Pierre . We have discovered a new element . An active element . The residue for pitch blende . What was left over After I extract the uranium and the thoarum it must be in there . Where it is ? In the resin ... Close the curtains . Ready ? Marie , if your four missing points are here our notion of the universe will be changed . Ready ? Read . Four . Oh , Pierre . Marie . This new concept . If we can prove the existence of this new element it may enable us to look into the secret of life itself deeper than ever before in the history of the world . Madame Curie , you must realize that the board has given you repetition every consideration . However ... the university has not an extensive budget for the creation of new laboratories and for the new equipment you ask for . You state that ... you and Dr. Curie had detected the presence of a new element an active element . But unfortunately you have given us no convincing proof of its existence . We have demonstrated of its existence experimentally . We have carried on our research intensely except for five weeks in the autumn . In September my daughter was born and a week later my husband has the misfortune to lose his mother . But the rest of the time , we have devoted entirely to research . And yet in this eight or nine months you have came no closer to any proof as to the existence of ah ... what is the name of it ? Ah , my wife has named it radium . Oh yes , radium I should like to ask Dr. Curie a question . Yes , Professor Roger This work . Will it require quite a little time will it not ? Yes , of course . But you are already teaching at school of physics and chemistry . And Madam Curie is teaching at the normal school at Sebra . It would be a formidable undertaking under the best of circumstances . Under these conditions hardly seems promising . And Madam Curie , in spite of her acknowledged abilities is if you would permit me to say so young inexperienced , and a woman . Gentleman . If you please . This remark seems to me entirely irrelevant . It is perfectly true that Madame Curie is young that she has not had the experience that most of us have had and as you say she is a woman . But let me impress upon you gentlemen that she is of most unusual woman I might say her , ah a most unusual woman . You ca n't classify her with that term I have had the opportunity of observing Madam Curie very closely and I can assure you , gentlemen that she is remarkable scientist as scrupulous as she is brilliant and furthermore ... Of course , gentlemen you understand that I am looking upon Madame Curie with complete coolness and complete detachment as I would in judging any other colleague . We understand that you are convinced as to the reliability of Madame curie 's investigation . Entirely , I have even put aside my own research to devote my entire time to collaborating with her in the isolation of this new element . Dr. Curie much as we would like to help you and Madame Curie our budget does not provide the purposes of this kind . However , the suggestion was made by Professor Roger in which we have unanimously concurred to offer you the use of the shade across the courtyard from the school of physics . We are aware that this shade is not the most suitable place for your investigation . Gentlemen am I to understand that you are offering us the old shade across from the physics building ? The one , that was used as a dissecting room by medical students ? If this abominable shade is available , it 's only because no one can be found who is willing to work in it . The roof leaks . It has no floor but the wet ground . It ca n't be heated . In summer , it is stifling as a hot house and in winter , it freezes . And do you imagine that I would permit my wife to work under these appalling conditions ? If you do gentlemen , believe me ... With my husband 's permission we should be very glad to accept the shade . We shall be very grateful to have the shade . This was the shade across the courtyard from the school of physics . This was to be the laboratory of Marie and Pierre Curie The place was even worse than they had expected . There was no equipment . They were at the mercy of the worse extremes of the weather . How could they do anything worthwhile under such conditions ? If they 'd know at the start how long they will have to work here and what difficulties awaited them would they have dare to begin ? Well , yes , they probably would . They were that kind of people . At first it was sheer physical labor beyond the strength of either of them . During those winter days they carried on between them the work of the entire chemical plant . The raw material was pitch blende from the mines of Bohemia tons of it from which they plan to extract all the known elements until only a few ounces remain . From this few ounces , radium their precious element was eventually to be isolated . In the beginning in spite of the bitter cold the work had to be done out of doors because of the fire and fumes . The first step was to melt the crude ore on a large oblong tank till it was boiling like lava . Then acid was poured in . This was to dissolve out the salts . When this was done the next stage was to melt down the residue in separate cordon another back breaking job for the fire must not go out . Night or day either Pierre or Marie had to be on hand all the time . Dogged determination kept them going through month after month of such arduous dangerous work but even so it began at last to tear on both Pierre and Marie . This was something they had to fight continually the gas fumes . Eventually , months run into years The kind of works changed but Pierre had to build or assemble their equipment and with any material that lay at hand . What was left of the original pitch blende had now to be filtered and re-filtered to remove other elements . And this work were not quite so physically strenuous was hard enough specially during the hot summer days . And so the work went on until presently everything had been removed from the tons of ore except two final elements one was barium and the other which they had began to think of it in their heart as their own element was the precious illusive radium . Pierre and Marie thought that the end of their task must surely be in sight . All that was now left was to separate these two survivors barium and radium . This was the problem to separate barium and radium somehow or other . No separation . No separation . No separation . September the 12th 1899 . Reduction of pitch blende nearly finish . Only barium and radium remain . The next separation will give radium . November the 8th , 1899 . First experiment . No separation . November the 10th , 1899 . Second experiment . No separation . July the 16th , 1900 . Four hundred and fifty eight experiments . Radium still refuses to separated from barium . Alright , then , radium would n't be separated from barium . We 've done all we can and more more than most people would have done thanks to your tenacity but it 's useless . We 'll never find a way of separating . Barium and radium can not be separated . How much longer do you think we can stand this insufferable heat stifling in summer and freezing in winter . How much longer do you think you can drive yourself like this ? And how much longer do you think I can stand by and watch you destroy yourself ? The world has done without radium up to now . What does it matter if it is isolated for another 100 years . I ca n't give it up . If it takes a hundred years it would be a pity but I am going to see how far I could go , even my lifetime We have never seen burns quite like this before they are very strange . I ca n't ever remember seeing anything quite like them they obviously do n't come from any normal substance . Madame Curie how long have been making your experiments with this unknown element ? For the past three three and a half years . And have these burns given you much pain ? No . They are irritating at times but I never pay attention to them until lately . I see . It is obvious that you are dealing with some remarkable powerful force . As to what these burns are exactly there is no means of telling . I do n't wish to alarm you Madame Curie but it is possible that these burns might become serious might in fact develop malignantly if you continue to expose them excessively to your unknown element . It is not impossible they may be developed into a cancerous nature . It is my advice , Madame that you abandon your experiments . Cancer . No , Pierre . He only said the burns might develop malignantly Like develop into cancer . No . He said they might possibly develop into a cancerous nature but only if it excessively exposed to our radium . So if we 're careful there is nothing to be frightened about . But the very word frightens me . You saw how it took my own mother . We 'll have to give up our experiments If we are dealing with as powerful a forces there is no telling what ... I would n't allow it . I would n't let you take such risk I wo n't permit you . No , Marie . Pierre , please . Listen to me , please . There is something I must tell you and then you should decide as you wish . Very well , Marie . As I left the doctor I have been thinking . This element of ours obviously has a terrific power . Power enough to affect healthy tissue like mine . Power enough to destroy tissue . Pierre , if it has this power why has n't it also the power to destroy unhealthy tissue ? You realize what that might mean ? It could heal . By destroying unhealthy tissue it could heal all men of diseases Like cancer ? You ? Yes , Pierre . It might even do that . We do n't know what things it might do for people . But , Marie ... Oh , Pierre . Ca n't you see how unimportant little things like these are compared to what it might mean ? It might prevent great sicknesses even deaths . Pierre . And so they went on with their work using every possible precaution . Marie 's fingers healed . And though they did not find a way to separate radium and barium in a single process they did discover a method of removing barium little by little in infinite decimal amounts . Working on the theory that once the whole of the barium is removed nothing could be left but radium . Here we see the sort of things they had to do . This is called crystallization . When the liquid evaporates crystals are left . This was the thing they had to do over and over again . It proved to be the most exacting of all of the stages of their long test . For it continues for two years and require thousands of separate operations . By now the residue from all the various processes they had worked at lay in hundreds of this small evaporating bowls . Small , because larger quantities would not evaporate so quickly . Crystallizing and re-crystallizing . Each operation they hope bring them closer and closer to the heart of the great mystery . At last , they arrive at the final crystallization the one that contains the concentrated results of all the others . The last survivors out of those hundreds of evaporating bowls . I think I feel like crying Professor Poirot . Professor Poirot . Madam Curie , but I am afraid I have come at a crucial moment . No . No . We have finished . We have nothing to do now but wait . I am delighted to see you . There is nobody we 'd rather have waited at this moment than you . Thank you . And I have brought with me an very illustrious visitor . No more illustrious than these young folks will be . The name of Curie will lead all the rest . Your taller , my boy , considerably than I have imagine . And you , Madame , so young , so beautiful and so brilliant I do n't know which is the greater miracle you or radium . Why do n't you introduce me Poirot ? I think I know . Is n't it Lord Kelvin ? I absolutely refuse to return to London without meeting you both . As long as the greatest living scientist believe in the existence of radium what the other thoughts did n't seem to matter . Here are the evaporating dishes . How many crystallization did you make hundreds I suppose ? Tell him , Pierre . Look here , sir . Five thousands six hundred and seventy-seven . And the last crystallization is in there , I supposed . Five thousands six hundred and seventy-seven . And thus crystallization . What a historic moment . That little bowl represents eight tons of pitch blende and four years of work . In a few hour the water will be gone and only radium will remain . Pure radium . I am sort of tempted to stay and see it but it 's New Year 's Eve and my family is expected me in London . Mine is just as well . This great moment should belong to the two of you alone . You begin the year , my friends that will mark your fame . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye , Sir . C'mon along , Poirot . My train wo n't wait . Goodnight , dear , Goodbye . I shall come back to Paris next week and see your radium with my own eye . You can send me a telegram tonight and describing it to me . We have a coin over there . We wrote something out for this occasion Bring out the old bring in the new bring out the false bring in the true . Good bye . God blessed you . Good bye . Good bye . What a wonderful man . The really great men are always simple and good . Yes . We 're both very tired . Yes . Shall we try to get some rest ? Very well Sit here a while and I cover you with this robe . There . Put that chair over . I ca n't reach you Yeah . That 's better . Let 's try to doze off . Pierre . What time is it ? I overslept . I must be tired . It is five . Must be crystallized by now . Must be there . Our radium must be there . C'mon . Do you mind ? You look first . There 's nothing there not a trace of anything not a grain . Only a stain . What had happened Pierre ? Where is our radium ? What have we done ? Where is it ? What 's happened ? Where is it , Pierre ? I do n't know . What did we do that was wrong ? What could we have done ? We 've done nothing wrong . I ca n't stand it , Pierre Where is our radium ? We worked for years and years and years It must be there . It must be there . Four long years in this shed . Four long years . Is that you ? Yes , Father . Well , something 's got to be don about that child of yours . I think you ought to take it back . I let her stand on my head to let her eat her supper and now she ... now she , now she wo n't go to bed until her mother tells her story . I like to know what 's the matter with my stories . They are the same stories . I 'll go up to her . Then what happened , Mommy . I am sorry , Irene darling . Mother just ca n't tell you anymore tonight . Oh , Mommy , please . What is the matter , Mommy ? But , I wanted to know what happen , Mommy If you close your eyes tight Daddy will tell you a story . What 's it about ? Well , ah , its about ah , it 's about a strange and wonderful treasure that was locked up in an enchanted stone . Is there a princess in it ? Yes , a princess . A beautiful princes with golden hair . Is there a prince too ? No , not a prince but a man who live all alone until the princess found him . Did they love each other ? Very much . Alright , Daddy my eyes are closed Well , now , one day the princes told the man about this wonderful treasure so they decided to go and search of it together . Now , no one had ever seen this treasure of course , but the princes knew that it was there . And she knew if they could get it out of the stone , it might let people see wonderful things that they had never been able to see before . So they worked very hard for a long long time to try and rescue the treasure from the stone . And they grew very tired And at last , they knew that ... they would never be able to free the treasure from the enchant of the stone but they were n't sad about it because they knew that no matter how many disappointment they had they would always go on together . Having the courage to take many disappointments because they were together and they live happily ever after . She is asleep . You know , we promised David that ... But I supposed you naturally do n't feel like ... Oh , I remember . The New Year 's Party . But , of course you do n't feel like going . Pierre , we promised . Let 's go . I 'd rather . Might help . Good . Good then . Happy New Year . Happy New Year . Happy New Year . Happy New Year , Marie . Happy New Year , Pierre . Try to put it out of your mind Marie and go to sleep I ca n't . I ca n't accept it , Pierre . But , Marie , sometimes there are things you just must accept it If I only knew why we fail . I think that the failure itself I would n't mind so much about it but the reason for it . Months and months and months ago you did find the right process to use . At the very end why should it suddenly fail ? I do n't know . I do n't know . Pierre , that stain on the saucer . Yes . We did n't even test it , did we ? No , we did n't . What we are expecting to find was a definite amount of radium was n't it ? Something we could see and feel . Not as much as a pinch of salt you said Yes . Pierre , what if it 's ... a merely a question of amount ? What does so little radium in proportion to the amount of material that we use that we now we could n't see it . What if that stain ? Even with the merest merest breath ... Go on . Pierre , could it ... be that that stain is radium ? Pierre . It 's there . Our radium . It 's there . It 's there . Pierre . Pierre . It 's there . It 's there . It 's there . Oh , Pierre . Where are they ? Are they in Paris or go wherever they are . I am not going to tell you where they are . But , Dr. Curie I am the representative of the London Times and there are representatives here from the presses of all the great nations in the world . Do n't Dr. and Madame Curie realize they ca n't hide from the press ? The whole world is on fire from their discovery . The publics want to know about them . We have heard that they had refused to take in money for their radium that they are giving it to the world . The Nobel Prize to a woman . These are important matters Dr. curie and the world must be told about them . Yes , the public must know . Did they give it for free ? Where are they now ? Gentlemen all that I know is Pierre and Marie are very tired . They have been interviewed so much that I ca n't see there is any more to tell that the public would be interested in . They 're sick . They 've gone away on a holiday to rest . Now , it 's utterly impossible for any newspaperman in the world to try to interview Dr. or Madame Curie at the present time I 'm sorry . Excuse me . I am from The Courier the newspaper in Grandovland . Do you think I could see Madame Curie ? I 'm afraid you ca n't see her . They 've come here to rest . It 's their first holiday in five years . You would n't want to disturb them . Perhaps you could tell me something about her . I ca n't go back without some sort of story . Would you like to have something for your paper that very people know yet ? Oh , I certainly would . Well . Put in your newspaper that the University has granted Dr. and Mme . Curie a splendid new laboratory with many rooms the latest equipment many assistants . It will be presented to them in a formal ceremony next week . Next week ? There . Fair enough . That 's fine , Madame . That 's wonderful . I do n't know how to thank you . I can tell you I was scared of meeting Mme . Curie but it was rather important to me . You see this is my first assignment if I could have gotten the interview it would help a lot . Well , monsieur . You can tell your newspaper that you got your interview with Mme . Curie . Madame . Good bye . Are you ... are you Mme . Curie ? Yes . And this is my daughter Irene . It 's a new bicycle so she has to show it off . And now ... Mommy ... Oh , yes . My baby . This is E. She 's been a good baby ? Very good , Madame . Been very good , darling ? Yes . Wei , Madame . Did she drink her milk ? Yes . Alright ... Wei , Madame . Well , keep her out in the airy deck . Alright . Off you go . Now she made a grand tour of the garden And now you 'll excuse me . Good bye . Good bye . Know what I 'm doing ? Pierre . I thought you were asleep . No . I 'm walking through the new laboratory . Do n't imagine it too grand . It might not come up to your expectations . And at the moment , I 'm walking down the long white hall . And I 'm with you ? Yes , you are with me . Now I 'm examining your work table . I do n't believe it 's large enough . How 's yours ? Oh , yes . I have n't got there yet . It will be exciting , wo n't it ? When we walk in the first time . Yes . It will be wonderful to get back to work again . We lost so much time . Oh , Pierre . The time we spent here has n't been lost We got our strength back . Yes , that 's true . We were ill , both of us more than we knew . You know , when we first came here I used to have fantastically morbid thoughts sometimes . What do you mean ? Well , everyday that passed seem so completely lost . I have a feeling that I did n't have much time to lose , that my days were ... well , it ... that I must n't waste them that I have to drive ahead quickly in order to have time to finish everything I wanted to finish It 's odd how one 's mind would ... Why , Marie . What a horrible thought to have . It 's just because I was so ill. How could such a thought entered your mind . Oh , darling . Do n't take it so seriously It frightens me . I 'm sorry I mentioned it . It was nothing . It 's because I was so worn out . You know , Marie , how tired I was . Pierre . If one of us should ever go the other could n't go on alone . Could n't be expected of us could it ? Oh , Marie . I 've upset you . Could it , Pierre ? You were wrong , Marie . Whatever happens if one should go the other must stay on . One must work just the same . But I for one had no intention of going anywhere except to our wonderful new laboratory . Only one more week . Just think of it . After all this waiting only one more week . Pierre ? Yes , dear . Come back here . Ha ? Come back . What is it ? I want to tell you something . Sit down . Well ? What is it ? So hard . I just ca n't find the words . Pierre , are you proud of me ? Marie . Because I 'm so proud of you . I 'm so proud that sometimes I think I 'll burst . You 're a very great man , Pierre . Not the way the world means . Just you . Your kindness , your gentleness and your wisdom . I love you , Pierre , so deeply . I never dreamed ... I 'm so thankful , Pierre . That 's what I wanted to tell you . That 's what I thought you 'll always know . France sees it fit to bestow the famous scientific couple a truly great honor in reward for their services to science and to mankind . Well , are you truly impressed ? The president and faulty of the University of Paris will present Pierre and Mme . Curie with a fully equipped laboratory with which to carry on their many experiments they have opened the gateway to . At 6:30 on 19th , April that 's today , you know . There will be a formal presentation of the laboratory at which the world famous couple will appear . Not bad , eh ? Not bad . Good morning . Good morning . Good morning , Father . Good morning Good morning , children . What 's the matter with this place today ? After all it was no different than any other day , is n't it ? This house is in a turmoil . Everything is upside down topsy turvy nothing in its place . Where is your mother ? I have n't seen her for hours . I do n't know how I 'm going to remember everything . And , ah ... Where 's my coffee ? I 'm late . Oh . Thank you , Lucille . Do n't know where your mother has gone . The house without a woman I do n't understand . Marie ? Mother 's in there . What 's she doing in there ? Mother 's in there . Mother 's in there . Marie . I would n't go in there , Pierre if I were you . She 's having the last fitting on her new dress she 's going to wear tonight for the presentation . It 's supposed to be a surprise . Oh , good . Good . That 's a very sound idea . Yeah . Remember I did n't tell you . No . Pardon me , is Dr. Pierre here ? That 's him . Oh . Mme . Curie would like to see you . You like it , Pierre ? It 's for this evening for the ceremony You look very beautiful , Marie . You really like it ? I do . Very much . What color is that ? It 's , ah , very deep red . You want to have some kind of a little ornament , have n't you ? Oh , nonsense . Yes . Yes , you should . Something ... something bright . I 've seen them on women . They look nice Now you 're making me self-conscious . Oh , I was thinking what a pity evening dress becomes you so . But there you are we just haven't had the time , have we ? Oh , look at that . Our beautiful day ruined . Oh , I was going to spend the day in the park with the children . Well , I must be off . I have a hundred things to do today . I promise to go to the institute I have to look at the proofs of my paper from my publisher and endless thing . I want to clean everything up and start fresh from the laboratory in the morning . You must n't be late . You must allowed yourself time to dress Madame . Madame , the pins . Oh . Oh . Perhaps one day I 'll get a new dress suit . You know I have had mine since I got my Doctors degree . Looks bad on me , is n't it ? No , Pierre . You look very handsome in anything Thank you , Marie . Good bye . Good bye , darling . They 're always calling for us at six . I 'll be here . Do n't forget your rubbers . No . Or your umbrella . Good bye . Good bye , Pierre . Pierre ... Is there something I can show you Monsieur ? I would like to buy a pair of earrings for a lady . We 're going to a party tonight . Yes , Monsieur . Did you have anything special in mind ? Well , I 've seen women wearing earrings that I thought were very pretty . Of course , I would like to get something that would match the lady 's gown . May I ask the color of the gown monsieur ? It 's dark red . It 's rather a special gown . Not blow , of course , but ... What do you think of these Monsieur . They 're amethysts They 're very lovely . Oh , yes , are n't they . And what are these ? Those are garnets . Really ? They 're both lovely . I hardly know ... It would depend on the shape of the lady 's face . Is it oval or round ? I would say that her face was oval . Yes , oval . And is she blond or ... Blond , definitely . But not too blond . I mean , she ca n't ... well just blond . And her hair is sort of gold you know Gold ? Yes . And her eyes are gray . Very calm gray . The coloring is very lovely . Sort of smooth skin and nice delicate , coloring and well I ... I do n't know if it will be of any help to you but the lady is quite beautiful . Lovely . You look very beautiful my dear . Thank you . It 's rather unusual to be praised for the way I look . I 'm sure you could have had that praise from men if you 'd had wished it . Thank you , Father . I do n't understand Pierre being late today of all days . Well , you know , Pierre . I brought in some wine . I thought we might all drink to that new laboratory before you go . Oh , that was thoughtful of you Father . That must be Professor Poirot and Pierre 's not here . Let me . Pierre ? Mme . Curie , it is my painful due to inform you that ... your husband has been the victim of a street accident . He was instantly killed . It came at such no pain . Has she any better ? Just the same . I ca n't get her to speak to me . I 'm frightened . Is she in there ? Yes . Forgive me , if I intrude . I do so as Pierre 's old friend as your old friend and teacher . Please try to attend to what I say . Try to hear my words . Think what Pierre what he should do . How he would want you to live now . It is my believed that he would wish you to continue his and yours . My friend ... I know how much the laboratory meant to Pierre . I know how much hurt if it was n't to be yours . It was his dream that someday you and he would stand there together . I know it is very hard for you to think of going on by yourself when you have done everything together so many years . One must go on working just the same . You must find somewhere within yourself the strength to carry on Pierre 's work and you own . Ha ? Ten years ago you told me so often that you were impressed by something I said when you were a student in my class . I spoke of Newton and Galileo and I said that probably none of you would ever reach so high to get the star in your fingertips . I was wrong . I have , too , seen you reaching to the high place of knowledge and get your star under your fingertips . Marie , there are more stars . The Faculty of Science of University of Paris invites you to attend the ceremony honored by the presence of Mme . Curie to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the discovery of radium . Yes , she was famous now . This frail , stubborn , eager woman had carried on her great work for a quarter of a century . Mme . Curie . Even now , after twenty-five years of intensive research , we feel there is a great deal still to be done . We have made discoveries . Pierre Curie , in the suggestions we found in his notes and in thoughts he expressed to me has helped to guide us to him . But no one of us can do much if each of us perhaps can catch some glimpse knowledge which modestly insufficient itself may add to man 's dream of truth . It is by these small candles in our darkness that we see before us little by little the dim outlines of that great plan that shapes the universe . And I am among those who think that for this reason , science has great beauty and with its great spiritual strength will in time cleanse this world of its evils it 's ignorance , poverty , diseases wars and heartaches Look for the clear light of truth Look for unknown new roads even when men 's sight is keener far from now . Divine wonder will never fail us . Every age has its own dream . Leave then the dreams of yesterday You take the torch of knowledge and build the palace of the future .

I wondered if it was like one I ran into . Have you met Archimedes ? The one with black spots . See ? You remember Archimedes of Syracuse ? Eh ? The king asks Archimedes to determine if a present he has received is actually solid gold . Unsolved problem at the time . It tortures the great Greek mathematician for weeks . Insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns in his bed for nights on end . Finally , his equally exhausted wife , forced to share a bed with this genius , convinces him to take a bath , to relax . While he 's entering the tub , he notices the bath water rise . Displacement - a way to determine volume , and thus a way to determine density . Weight over volume . And thus Archimedes solves the problem . He screams `` Eureka ! '' and he is so overwhelmed , he runs naked through the streets to the king 's palace to report his discovery . Now , what is the moral of the story ? That a breakthrough will come . Wrong ! The point of the story is the wife . Listen to your wife , she 'll give you perspective . Meaning , you need a break .

Excuse me ? You asked me if I 'd seen a 216-digit number . Oh , yeah . You mean the bug . I ran into it working on Pi . - What do you mean ran into it ? - Max , what 's this about ? There are these religious Jews I 've been talking to . Religious Jews ? Yeah , Hasids , the guys with beards . I know them . I know one in a coffee shop . He 's a number theorist . The Torah is his data set . He says they 're after a 216-digit number in the Torah . Come on , it 's just coincidence . There 's something else , though . What ? You remember those weird stock picks ? - Yesterday 's stock picks ? Yes . - They were correct . I got two picks on the nose . Smack on the nose , Sol . Something 's going on . It has to do with that number . There 's an answer in it . Max ... Come with me . The ancient Japanese considered the Go board to be a microcosm of the universe . Although , when it 's empty , it appears simple and ordered , the possibilities of gameplay are endless . No two Go games are alike , just like snowflakes . So , the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe . And that 's the truth of our world , Max . It ca n't be easily summed up with math . There is no simple pattern . But as the game progresses , the possibilities become smaller . The board takes on order . Soon , every move 's predictable . So ? So maybe , even though we 're not aware of it , there is a pattern , an order underlying every Go game . Maybe it 's like the pattern in the stock market ? The Torah ? This 216 number ? - It 's insanity . - Maybe it 's genius . - I must get that number . - Hold on ! You 're losing it . You have to breathe . Listen to yourself . You 're connecting my computer bug with one you might 've had and some religious hogwash . If you want the number 216 , you can find it everywhere . corner to your front door , you spend in the elevator When your mind becomes obsessed you filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere . You 've chosen 216 and you'll find it everywhere in nature . But , Max , as soon as you discard scientific rigour , you are no longer a mathematician , you 're a numerologist . Mr Cohen ? Mr Cohen ... God damn it ! I 'm sick of you following me . I 'm not interested in money . I want to understand our world . I do n't deal with materialists like you . I 'm sorry . I 'm very sorry .

Max , you have to give us the number . What is it ? The Talmud tells us it began 2,000 years ago , when the Romans destroyed the second temple . What is this ? Max , you 'll understand if you listen . The Romans also destroyed our priesthood , the Cohanim . And with their deaths , they destroyed our greatest secret . In the centre of the temple was the heart of Jewish life , the holy of holies . It was the earthly residence of our God . The one God . It housed the Ark of the Tabernacle , which stored the original 10 Commandments which God gave to Moses . Only one man was allowed to enter this holy of holies on one day , the holiest day of the year , Yom Kippur . On the Day of Atonement , all of lsrael would descend upon Jerusalem to watch the High Priest , the Cohen Godul , make his trip to the holy of holies . If the High Priest was pure , he would emerge moments later and we 'd have a prosperous year . It meant we were one year closer to the Messianic age . But , if he was impure , he would die instantly and it meant we were doomed . The High Priest had one ritual to perform there . He had to intone a single word . Yeah ? That word was the true name of God . So ? The true name , which only the Cohanim knew , was 216 letters long . Are you telling me that ... That the number in my head is the true name of God . Yes ! It 's the key to the Messianic age . It will take us closer to the Garden of Eden . As the temple burnt , the Talmud tells us the High Priest walked into the flames . He took the key to the top of the building , the heavens opened and received the key from the priest's outstretched hand . We have been looking for that key ever since . And you may have found it . That 's what happened . I saw God . No . You are not pure . You can not see God unless you are pure . No ... I saw everything . You saw nothing , only a glimpse . There 's so much more . We can unlock the door and show God we 're pure again . You 're not pure . How are you pure ? I found it ! Who do you think you are ? You are only a vessel from God . You 're carrying a delivery meant for us ! It was given to me . It 's inside of me . It 's changing me . It 's killing you ! Because you are not ready to receive it . It 's just a number . I 'm sure you 've written down every 216-digit number . You 've translated all of them . You 've intoned them all . Have n't you ? What 's it gotten you ? The number is nothing . It 's the meaning . The syntax . It 's what 's between the numbers . You have n't understood it . It 's because it 's not for you . I 've got it . I 've got it ! I understand it . And I 'm gon na see it .

When she wakes up , she 'll think it was a dream . - What did you bring her for ? - I had to do something . She saw the time machine . I couldn't leave her with that information . Do n't worry . She 's not essential to my plan . Well , you 're the doc , Doc . Here 's our exit . You 've got to get out and change clothes . Right now ? It 's pouring rain . Wait five more seconds . Right on the tick . Amazing . Absolutely amazing . Too bad the post office isn't as efficient as the weather service . Excuse the disguise , but I was afraid you would n't recognize me . I went to a rejuvenation clinic and got a whole natural overhaul . Took out some wrinkles , did a hair repair , changed the blood ... added 30 or 40 years to my life . They also replaced my spleen and colon . What do you think ? You look great , Doc . The future . Unbelievable . - I got to check this out , Doc . - All in good time . - We 're on a tight schedule . - Tell me about my future . Do I become , like , a rich rock star ? No one should know too much about their destiny . - I am rich , though , right ? - Marty , please , take off your shirt . Put on the jacket and the shoes . Got a mission to accomplish . Precisely on schedule . Power laces . All right . This thing does n't fit . Size-adjusting fit . Pull out your pants pockets . All kids here wear their pants inside out . Put on this cap . Perfect . You 're the spitting image of your future son . - What ? - Help me move Jennifer over here . - So what 's the deal ? - Grab her feet . Okay , now what ? In exactly two minutes , you go around the corner into the Caf '80s . Caf '80s ? It 's one of those nostalgia places , but not done well . Go in and order a Pepsi . Here 's $ 50 . Wait for a guy named Griff . Right . Griff . Griff 's going to ask about tonight . Are you in or out ? Tell him you are out . Whatever he says , say no , you 're not interested . Then leave , come back here and wait for me . Do n't talk to anyone . Do n't touch anything . Do n't do anything . Do n't interact with anyone ... and try not to look at anything . I do n't get it . - You said this had to do with my kids . - Look what happens to your son . My son ? God , he looks just like me . `` Within two hours of his arrest , Martin McFly Jr ... was tried , convicted , and sentenced to 15 years in the state penitentiary '' ? Within two hours ? The justice system works swiftly now that they 've abolished lawyers . This is heavy . It gets worse . Your daughter tries to break him out and gets sent up for 20 years . My daughter . I have a daughter ? This one event starts a chain reaction that destroys your entire family . Doc , this date ... This is tomorrow 's newspaper . Precisely . I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens . I backtracked everything to this one event . We 're here to prevent this event from happening . Damn ! I 'm late ! Where are you going now ? To intercept the real Marty Jr. You 're taking his place . The Caf '80s , guy named Griff , just say no ! What about Jennifer ? We ca n't just leave her here . She 'll be safe . It 'll just be for a few minutes . Marty , be careful . That Griff has a few short circuits in his bionic implants . The future . Welcome to Texaco .

So , McFly , have you made a decision about tonight 's opportunity ? Yeah , Griff . I was thinking about how I'm not sure because it might be dangerous . What 's wrong , McFly ? You got no scrote ? He 's a complete wimp . What 's it going to be , McFly ? Are you in or out ? I just , I 'm not sure that I should . I should discuss it with my father . Your father ? Wrong answer , McFly ! You lose ! Okay , Griff , I 'll do it . Whatever you say . Stay down and shut up . Keep pedaling , you two ! Now ... let 's hear the right answer . Since when did you become the physical type ? The answer 's no , Griff . - No ? - Are you deaf and stupid ? I said no ! What 's wrong , McFly ? Chicken ? What did you call me , Griff ? Chicken , McFly ! Nobody calls me ... chicken . - All right , punk ! - Look ! Stop ! Little girl , little girl . Stop . Look , I need to borrow your `` hoverboard '' . - Where is he ? - Here . There ! He 's on a hoverboard . - Get the boards ! - Get McFly ! Get him ! Yeah , we got him ! There 's something very familiar about all this . McFly , you bojo ! - Those boards do n't work on water ! - Unless you 've got power ! Hook on ! Batter up ! Holy shit ! Buttheads . Drying mode on . Jacket drying . Your jacket is now dry . Hey , kid . Hey , little girl , thanks . Keep it . I got a Pit Bull now . - Come on . - Save the clock tower ! Throw in $ 100 and help save the clock tower .

I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season , bet on the Cubbies ! This has an interesting feature . It has a dust jacket . Books had these to protect the covers . That was before dust-repellent paper . If you 're interested in dust , we have something from the 1980s ... called a Dustbuster . - I ca n't lose . - Up here ! - Doc , what 's going on ? - Stand by . I 'll park over there . Yeah , all right . Hey , right on time . Flying DeLorean ? I have n't seen one in 30 years . Sorry . Excuse me . Sorry . I 'm walking here ! I 'm walking here ! - What the hell ? - Do n't drive trank , low-res scuzzball ! Two of them ? I left him in a suspended animation kennel . Einstein never knew I was gone ! What in the name of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here ? Doc , my kid showed up . All hell broke loose . Your kid ? Great Scott , I was afraid of this . I used it on Jennifer . There was n't enough power left to knock your son out . Doc , look at this ! It 's changing . I was framed ! Yes ! Yes , of course ! Because this hoverboard incident occurred , Griff goes to jail . Your son wo n't go with him tonight . That robbery wo n't take place ! History , future history , has been altered , and this is proof ! We 've succeeded , not as planned , but no matter . Let 's get Jennifer and go home ! Hi , Einie . Hi , buddy . - What 's this ? - A souvenir . `` 50 years of sports statistics '' . Hardly recreational reading material . Doc , what 's the harm in bringing back some info on the future ? We could place some bets . I did n't invent the time machine for financial gain ! The intent is to gain a clearer perception of humanity . Our past , our future , the pitfalls , the possibilities ... the perils , and the promise . Perhaps an answer to that universal question , `` Why ? '' I 'm all for that . What 's wrong with making a few bucks on the side ? I am going to put this in the trash . Great Scott ! McFly , Jennifer Jane Parker , Hilldale , age 47 . - What 's happening ? - They used her thumbprint to assess her ID . Since thumbprints never change , they assume she 's the future Jennifer . We got to stop them . How ? Tell them we 're time travelers ? They 'd have us committed . She 's clean . We take her home . To Hilldale ? We wo n't get there before dark . They 're taking her to your future home ! We 'll arrive shortly thereafter , get her , and return to 1985 . I 'll see where I live . See myself as an old man ? No , that could result in ... Great Scott ! Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self ! The consequences could be disastrous ! - What do you mean ? - I foresee two possibilities . One , seeing herself 30 years older would put her into shock , and she 'd pass out ... or two , the encounter could create a time paradox ... and cause a chain reaction that would unravel ... the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe ! Granted , that 's a worst-case scenario . The destruction might be localized , limited to our own galaxy . Well , that 's a relief . Let 's go and find Jennifer before she finds herself . The skyway 's jammed . It 'll take forever to get there . And this stays here ! I did n't invent the time machine to win at gambling , but to travel through time ! I know . So , Doc Brown invented a time machine . Hilldale . Nothing but a breeding ground for tranks , lobos , and zipheads . Yeah , they ought to tear this whole place down . Welcome home , Jennifer . You got a little tranked , but I think you can walk . Ma'am , you should reprogram . It 's dangerous in the dark . - Lights on ? - Yes . Now , look . Just take it easy , and you 'll be fine . And be careful in the future . The future ? Have a nice day , Mrs. McFly . Broadcasting beautiful views You 're tuned to the Scenery Channel . I 'm in the future . I get married in the Chapel O Love ? Mom ? Mom , is that you ? I got to get out of here ! Mom ? Mom , is that you ? - Grandma ! - Sweetheart ! - What happened to Grandpa ? - He threw his back out again . - How 's Granddad 's little pumpkin ? - How did you do that ? Out on the golf course . Are your folks home yet ? I brought pizza ! - Who 's going to eat all that ? - I will . Damn this traffic ! Jennifer , old Jennifer gets home around now . I hope we 're not too late . - What is it ? What 's the matter , Doc ? - I thought I saw a taxi . I thought it was following us . I ca n't believe this window 's still broken . When the repairman called Daddy a chicken ... Daddy threw him out of the house . Now nobody will fix it . Look how worn out this is . Your father 's biggest problem is that he loses all self-control ... when someone calls him chicken . How often have we heard it ? `` Mom , I ca n't let him think I 'm chicken '' . You 're right . Well , you 're right ! About 30 years ago , your father tried to prove he was n't chicken . He ended up in an automobile accident . With the Rolls-Royce ? Automobile accident . All right , Einie , let 's find Jennifer . I live in Hilldale ? This is great ! Stay here , change clothes . If I need you , I 'll holler . I want to check out my house . We ca n't risk you running into your older self . Einie , let 's go . Hilldale . This is bitchin ' . One , seven , four point five zero . - That will be $ 174.50 . - Here . Be careful in this neighborhood . - Where 's my receipt ? - Right here . How about a tip ? That accident caused a chain reaction , sending Marty 's life down the tubes . Otherwise , your father 's life would have turned out differently . The man would n't have pressed charges ... Marty would n't have broken his hand , given up on his music ... and spent years feeling sorry for himself . Hey , Mom , nice pants . The reason your mother married him ... Mom ? Turn off . I want channels 18 , 24 , 63 , Bringing you the world 's weather 24 hours a day . Weather conditions remain the same ... Board-certified implant surgeons ... Welcome home , Marty . Dad 's home . That 's right . He 's home . Dad 's home . - Lord of the manor . - Hello . - King of the castle . - Hello . What the hell is this ? Lithium mode on . Yeah . That 's better . Damned kids . Hey , Son . Watching a little TV for a change ? Son of a ... - I 'm hungry . - Just wait your turn . When it 's ready , shove it in my mouth . Do n't you be a smart-ass . Hey ! The Atrocity Channel . Hydrate level 4 , please . Is it ready ? Here you go . Mom , you sure can hydrate a pizza . I 'm sorry . I missed that whole thing . I 'm just worried about Jennifer . - Why is n't she home ? - I 'm not sure where Jennifer is , Mom . She should have been home hours ago . - I ca n't keep track ... - Fruit ! - Fruit , please . - She 's in one of those moods . Are n't you and her getting along ? Yeah . Great , Mom . We 're like a couple of teenagers . Dad , telephone . It 's Needles . Dad , it 's for you . All right . Well , I 'll take that in the den . Retract . Hello . In here , please . Hey , the big M. How 's it hanging , McFly ? Hey , Needles . Needles ? Did you look at my little business proposal ? - I do n't know . - Why are you worried ? If this works , your financial problems are solved . And if it does n't work , Needles , I could get fired . It 's illegal . I mean , what if the Jits is monitoring ? - The Jits will never find out . - God . Come on . Stick your card in the slot , and I 'll handle it . Unless you want everyone in the division to think you 're chicken . Nobody calls me chicken , Needles . - Nobody ! - All right . Prove it . All right . All right , Needles . Here 's my card . Scan it . I 'm in . Thanks , McFly . I 'll see you at the plant tomorrow . Shit . Fujitsu-san . I was monitoring that scan you just interfaced . You are terminated ! Terminated . No ! It was n't my fault , sir . - Needles was behind it . - And you cooperated . It was a sting operation . I was setting him up . Read my fax ! No ! Please ! I can not be fired . I 'm fired . This is heavy . What am I going to tell Jennifer ? Doc . Am I glad to see you . Go out the front door . I 'll meet you there . But it does n't open . There 's no doorknob . Press your thumb to the plate . What plate ? What does this fax mean ? Mom . It 's a joke , an office joke . It 's a joke fax . - I heard you yell . - Calm down . I was n't yelling . Needles and I were just joking . Welcome home , Jennifer . Lost my job , Mom ? Get out of town . - I 'm young ! - I 'm old ! Marty , come quick ! Quick ! She encountered her older self and went into shock . She 'll be fine . Let 's get her back to 1985 . Then I 'll destroy the time machine . Destroy it ? What about that stuff about humanity and where we 're going ? The risks are too great , as this incident proves . And I was behaving responsibly . Imagine if the time machine fell into the wrong hands ? My only regret ... is that I 'll never get a chance to visit my favorite historical era ... the Old West . But time traveling is just too dangerous . Better that I devote myself to study ... the other great mystery of the universe : Women . Marty , Einie , brace yourselves for temporal displacement . Did we make it ? Are we back ? We 're back . Let 's put her in the swing . You can return in your truck and wake her . When she awakens here in her own house ... you can convince her it was a dream . We 're just leaving her here ? Disorientation will help convince her it was a dream . How long will she be out ? I 'm not quite sure . She received quite a shock . Could be a few minutes , probably a couple of hours . - You better bring smelling salts . - You 're the doc , Doc . Come on . Let 's go , Einie . Do n't worry . She 'll be fine . I do n't remember bars being on these windows . If you need me , I 'll be in my lab dismantling this thing . Right . What the hell ? Wait a minute . What are you doing in my room ? - Rape ! Mom ! - Okay . Okay . - Dad , help ! - Freeze , sucker ! - I do n't want any trouble . - You got trouble now , you piece of trash . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm in the wrong house . You got that right , you son of a ... - Look . I made a mistake . - Damned right you made a mistake ! I 'm going to tear your ass up ! That 's right . You keep running , sucker ! Tell that realty company I ai n't selling ! We wo n't be terrorized ! This has got to be the wrong year . - It ca n't be . - Drop it . So you 're the son of a bitch who 's been stealing my papers . Mr. Strickland . - Mr. Strickland . It 's me , sir . Marty . - Who ? Martin McFly . Do n't you know me from school ? I 've never seen you before in my life , but you look like a slacker . Yeah , that 's right . I am a slacker . - You gave me detention last week . - The school burned down six years ago . You have three seconds to get off my porch with your nuts intact . - One . - I just want to know what 's going on . Two . Strickland ! Eat lead , slackers !

You 've been asleep for almost two hours . I had a horrible nightmare . It was terrible . Well , you 're safe and sound now , back on the good old 27th floor . Mom ? Mom , that ca n't be you .

You got kicked out of another boarding school ? Do you know how much dough I 've blown on your no-good kids ? What the hell do you care ? We can afford it . The least we can do with that money is provide a better life for our children . Hold on . Let 's get this straight . Marty is your kid , not mine . All the world 's money would n't help that lazy bum . Stop it , Biff . Just stop it . Look at him . He 's a butthead , just like his old man was . Do n't you dare speak that way about George . You 're not even half the man he was . You son of a bitch ! Always the little hothead ? You want to take a poke at me ? Damn it , Biff . That 's it . I 'm leaving . So go ahead . Think about this , Lorraine ! Who 's going to pay for your clothes ? And your jewelry and liquor ? Who 's going to pay for your cosmetic surgery ? You were the one who wanted me to get these things .

He 's my husband , and he takes care of all of us ... - and he deserves our respect . - Respect ? Your husband ! How could he be your husband ? - How could you leave Dad for him ? - Leave Dad ? - Marty , are you feeling all right ? - No , I 'm not feeling all right ! I do n't understand what 's going on here . Why nobody can give me a simple , straight answer . They must have hit you over the head hard this time . Mom , I just want to know one thing . Where 's my father ? Where 's George McFly ? George , your father , is in the same place he 's been for the past 12 years . Oak Park Cemetery . No ! This ca n't be happening ! `` March 15 , 1973 '' . No ! Please , God , no ! No , please , God . Please , God , no . This ca n't be happening . This ca n't be happening . This ca n't be ... I 'm afraid it is happening . All of it . When I learned about your father , I figured you 'd come here . Then you know what happened to him ? Do you know what happened ... March 15 , 1973 ? Yes , Marty . I know . I went to the public library to make sense of the madness . The place was boarded up . I broke in and borrowed newspapers . I do n't get it , Doc . How can all this be happening ? It 's like we 're in Hell or something . No , it 's Hill Valley , although I ca n't imagine Hell being much worse . Einie . I 'm sorry , boy . The lab is an awful , awful mess . Attaboy . Obviously , the time continuum has been disrupted ... creating this new temporal event sequence ... - resulting in this alternate reality . - English , Doc . Here , here . Let me illustrate . Imagine that this line represents time . Here 's the present , 1985 , the future , and the past . Prior to this point in time , somewhere in the past ... the time line skewed into this tangent ... creating an alternate 1985 . Alternate to you , me , and Einstein ... but reality for everyone else . Recognize this ? It 's the bag the sports book came in . I know , because the receipt was still inside . I found them in the time machine , along with this . It 's the top of Biff 's cane . I mean old Biff , from the future . Correct . It was in the time machine because Biff was in the time machine ... with the Sports Almanac . Holy shit . You see , while we were in the future ... Biff got the sports book , stole the time machine , went back in time ... and gave the book to himself at some point in the past . Look . It says right here ... that Biff made his first $ 1,000,000 betting on a horserace in 1958 . He was n't just lucky . He knew , because he had the race results in the Sports Almanac . That 's how he made his entire fortune . Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass . The Almanac . Son of a bitch stole my idea . He must have been listening when I ... It 's my fault . The whole thing is my fault . If I had n't bought that damn book ... none of this would have happened . - It 's all in the past . - The future . Whatever . It demonstrates precisely how time travel can be misused ... and why the time machine must be destroyed ... after we straighten all of this out . Right . So we go back to the future ... and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine . We ca n't , because if we travel into the future from this point in time ... it will be the future of this reality ... in which Biff is corrupt and powerful ... and married to your mother , and in which ... this has happened to me . No . Our only chance to repair the present is in the past ... at the point where the time line skewed into this tangent . In order to put the universe back as we remember it ... and get back to our reality , we have to find out the exact date ... and the specific circumstances of how , where , and when ... young Biff got his hands on that `` Sports Almanac '' . I 'll ask him . Bulletproof vest ! Great flick ! Great frigging flick ! The guy is brilliant . What the hell 's going ... - What the hell are you doing in here ? - Party 's over , Biff . Sorry , ladies . How did you get past my security downstairs ? There 's a matter we need to talk about . - Yeah . Money , right ? Well , forget it . - No . Not money . Gray 's Sports Almanac . You heard him , girls . Party 's over . Start talking , kid . What else do you know about that book ? First you tell me how you got it . How , where , and when . All right . Take a seat . Sit down ! November 12 , 1955 . That was when . November 12 , 1955 . That was the date I went back ... That was the date of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm . You know your history . Very good . I 'll never forget that Saturday . I 'd picked my car up from the shop because I 'd rolled it in a drag race . I thought you crashed into a manure truck . How do you know about that ? My father told me about it . Your father ? Before he died . Yeah . Right . So there I was , minding my own business . This crazy old codger with a cane shows up . He says he 's my distant relative . I do n't see any resemblance . So he says , '' How would you like to be rich ? '' So I said , `` Sure '' . So he lays this book on me . He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event this century . All I have to do is bet on the winner and I 'll never lose . So I said , `` What 's the catch ? '' He says , '' No catch . Just keep it a secret . '' After that , he disappeared . I never saw him again . He told me one more thing . He said , `` Someday a crazy , wild-eyed scientist ... '' or a kid may show up asking about that book . `` And if that ever happens ... Funny . I never thought it would be you . Biff , you 're forgetting one thing . What the hell is that ? You 're dead , you little son of a bitch ! - There he is ! - Wait , kid ! Hurry ! There he is ! Go ahead , kid . Jump . A suicide will be nice and neat . What if I do n't ? Lead poisoning . What about the police , Biff ? They 're going to match the bullet with that gun . Kid , I own the police . Besides , they could n't match up the bullet that killed your old man . You son of a ... I suppose it 's poetic justice . Two McFlys with the same gun . Idiot . What the hell ... Nice job , Doc ! You 're not going to believe this . We 've got to go back to 1955 . I do n't believe it . That 's right , Doc . November 12 , 1955 . Unbelievable that old Biff could 've chosen that particular date . It could mean that that point in time contains some cosmic significance ... as if it were the temporal junction point of the entire space-time continuum ... or it could just be an amazing coincidence . Damn ! Got to fix that thing . All right . Time circuits on . What do you mean , time circuits on ? Doc , we 're not going back now . What about Jennifer ? Einstein ? We ca n't leave them . Do n't worry . Assuming we succeed on our mission ... this alternate 1985 will be changed into the real 1985 ... instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie . Jennifer and Einie will be fine . They 'll have no memory of this horrible place . - What if we do n't succeed ? - We must succeed . This is heavy , Doc . It 's like I was here yesterday . You were here yesterday , Marty . Amazing , is n't it ? Sunrise should be in about 22 minutes . You go into town . Track down young Biff and tail him . Sometime today , old Biff will show up to give young Biff the Almanac . Above all you must not interfere . Let old Biff believe he 's succeeded so he 'll leave 1955 ... - and bring the DeLorean to the future . - Right . Once old Biff is gone , grab the Almanac anyway that you can . - Remember , our futures depend on this . - You do n't have to remind me of that . Here 's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie to keep in contact . I 'll stay and repair the short in the time circuit . That way , we do n't risk anyone else stealing the time machine ... and I wo n't risk accidentally running into my other self . - Other self ? - Yes . There are now two of me here ... and there are two of you here . The other me is the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955 . The other me that helps the other you get back to 1985 . Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower ? That does n't happen until tonight . Be careful not to run into your other self . Let me give you some money . Have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities . - Get yourself some '50s clothes . - Check , Doc . Something inconspicuous . Doc . Come in . This is Marty . Over . - Roger , this is Doc . Are you there ? - Yeah , Doc . I 'm at the address . It 's the only Tannen in the book , but I do n't think this is Biff 's house . It looks like an old lady lives here . - Where are you going , Biff ? - I 'm going to get my car , Grandma . When are you coming back ? I want you to rub my toes . Shut up , you old bag . Give us our ball back . - What ball ? - That ball ! What are you talking about ? Give us our ball ! Ball ? - Is this your ball ? - Yeah ! - You want it back ? - Yeah . Go get it . Doc , it is Biff 's house . I 'm on him . Over . She 's all fixed up , but I could n't get her started . - Got a kill switch ? - You just need the right touch . Nobody can start this car but me . - The bill comes to $ 302.57 . - $ 300 ? $ 300 for a couple of dents ? That 's bullshit . It was horseshit . The whole car was horseshit . - Jones wanted $ 80 to haul it away . - I bet he resold it . - I got to get something . - You want something ? You can call Jones and if he wants to give you a refund ... $ 300 ! If I catch the guy that caused this I 'll break his neck . The manure . I remember that . - 4 cans for a $ 300 job ? - I ca n't have lunch in there . - Makes me nauseous . - I should get a case for $ 300 . It smells worse than the bathroom . The stench is never going to go away , Biff . Last time I do you a favor . Last time . It 's perfect , Lorraine . You 're going to look so good ! You 're going to look ... Look at what we have here . Nice dress , Lorraine . Although I think you 'd look better wearing nothing . - Take a long walk off a short pier . - There 's that dance at school tonight . Now that my car 's fixed ... I 'll give you the honor of going with the best-looking guy in school . I 'm busy . - Doing what ? - Washing my hair . That 's as funny as a screen door on a battleship . Screen door on a submarine , you dork . Biff , somebody already asked me to the dance . Who ? That bug George McFly ? - I 'm going with Calvin Klein , okay ? - Calvin Klein ? No , it 's not okay . - You 're going with me , understand ? - Get your cooties off me ! When will you get it through your skull ? You 're my girl . I would n't be your girl even if you had a million dollars ! Yes , you will ! It 's you and me , Lorraine . Watch it ! It 's meant to be . I 'm going to marry you someday , Lorraine . Someday you 'll be my wife ! You always did have a way with women . Get the hell out of my car , old man . You want to marry that girl ? I can help make it happen . - Who are you , Miss Lonely-hearts ? - Just get in the car , butthead . Who are you calling butthead , butthead ? How did you do that ? Nobody can start this car but me . Get in the car , Tannen . Today 's your lucky day . Watch where you 're driving , old man . If you dent this car , I 'll kill you . - This cost me $ 300 ! - Would you shut up about the car ? - How do you know where I live ? - Let 's just say we 're related , Biff . That being the case , I got a present for you . Something that 'll make you rich . - You want to be rich , do n't you ? - Yeah . Sure . Right . That 's rich . You 're going to make me rich ? You see this book ? This book tells the future . Tells the results of every major sports event till the end of this century . Football , baseball , horseraces , boxing . The information in here is worth millions , and I 'm giving it to you . That 's very nice . Thank you very much . Now , why do n't you make like a tree and get out of here ? It 's leave , you idiot . Make like a tree and leave . You sound like a fool when you say it wrong . All right , leave . And take your book with you . Do n't you get it ? You could make a fortune with this book . Let me show you . UCLA trails 17-16 . It 's 4th and 11 with only 18 seconds left of this game . I 'd say it 's all over for UCLA . Bet you a million bucks UCLA wins it 19-17 . - Are you deaf ? It 's over . You lost . - Yeah ? Here comes Decker with the kick . It 's up and looks good . Ball 's in the clear . Field goall UCLA wins 19-17 . Listen to that Coliseum crowd go wild . Jim Decker ... All right . What 's the gag ? How did you know what the score would be ? I told you , it 's in this book . All you got to do is bet on the winner , and you 'll never lose . All right . I 'll take a look at it . You damn fool ! Never leave this book laying around . Do n't you have a safe ? No , you do n't have a safe . Get a safe . Keep it locked up . Until then , keep it on you . - What are you doing ? - Do n't tell anybody , either . There 's one more thing . One day , a kid or a crazy old man ... who claims to be a scientist is going to come around asking ... I 'm trapped . Doc . Doc , come in . - What 's the report ? - Biff 's gone . He 's got the book . I 'm locked in Biff 's garage . Get me the hell out of here . I 'm at 1809 Mason Street . I ca n't take the DeLorean . Do n't worry . Somehow I 'll get there . Doc , wait a minute . Doc . Doc . Perfect . Biff ! Where are you going now ? I told you , Grandma , I 'm going to the dance . - When you coming home ? - The dance . I 'll get home when I get home . Do n't forget to turn out the garage light . Marty , Marty . Damn ! Where is that kid ? Doc . Doc , come in . Come in , Doc . Marty ! Come in . My ... Great Scott . My God . Doc , Doc , come in . Marty , what happened ? You were n't at Biff 's house . - I 'm in Biff 's car , heading for the Enchantment Under The Sea dance . We may have to abort this entire plan . It 's getting much too dangerous . The book 's on his dashboard . I 'll grab it when we arrive . You must be careful not to run into your other self . - My other self ? - Yes . Remember your mother is at that exact same dance with you . - Right . This could get heavy , Doc . - Heavy , heavy . Whatever happens , do n't let your other self see you ! - The consequences could be disastrous . - Excuse me , sir . Yes , you with the hat . - Who , me ? - Yes . Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths inch wrench from the toolbox . Five-eighths ? Do n't you mean three-quarters ? Why , you 're right . I presume you 're conducting some sort of weather experiment . That 's right . How did you know that ? I happen to have had a little experience in this area . I 'm hoping to see some lightning tonight ... although the weatherman says there 's no chance of rain . There 's going to be plenty of rain . Wind , thunder , lightning . - It 's going to be one hell of a storm . - Thanks . Nice talking to you . Maybe we 'll bump into each other again in the future . Or in the past . Doc , Doc ! Come in ! Where 's that punk Calvin Klein , anyway ? I do n't know . I ai n't his secretary . Well , find him . He caused me $ 300 damage . I owe him a knuckle sandwich . Get going ! - Are n't you coming ? - I 'm reading . Well , well , Mr. Tannen . How nice to see you here . - Mr. Strickland , nice to see you , sir . - Is that liquor I smell , Tannen ? I would n't know . I do n't know what it smells like because I 'm too young to drink it . I see . What have we here ? Sports stats , interesting subject . Homework , Tannen ? No , it ai n't homework , because , I ai n't at home . You got a real attitude problem , you know ? One day I 'll have you where I want you , in detention . Slacker ! Jesus , you smoke , too ? Marty , you sound just like my mother . Yeah , right . When I have kids , I 'll let them do anything they want . Anything at all . - I 'd like to have that in writing . - Yeah , me , too . Marty , why are you so nervous ? Yes ! `` Oh LL '' ? - Doc ! Doc ! - Hey , you . - Doc , come in ! - Marty , what 's up ? Doc ! I 'm in trouble . I blew it . - Where 's the book ? - Biff must have it . - I 've only got the cover . - Where 's Biff ? - You 're asking for it . - I do n't know . - Any idea ? - No ! He could be anywhere by now . The entire future depends on you getting that book ! - I know . I just do n't ... - Stop it ! Stop it , Biff . You 'll break his arm . Stop it ! Of course ! I got ta go . I got one chance ! My old man is about to deck Biff ! Yes ! Talk about dj vu . Are you okay ? Okay , everybody , let 's back up . Everybody just back up . Give him a little bit of room . It 's okay . I know CPR . I know CPR . - What 's CPR ? - You ! - He 's fine . - Did you just take his wallet ? He took that guy 's wallet . Doc , success . I got it . Thank goodness . Great , Marty . As soon as I reload the fusion generator we 'll meet on the roof of the school gym . On the roof . 10-4 . - It 's him ! - He 's in disguise . Guys , what 's that ? Come on ! Let 's get him ! Damn ! All right ! Let 's do another . Where did he go ? He just came in here ! - Look ! How did he get on stage ? - When he 's through , we 'll nail him . How did he change his clothes so fast ? It 's an oldie where I come from . All right , guys , blues riff in B . Watch me for the changes , and try and keep up , okay ? Doc , come in ! Come in . Listen , Biff 's guys chased me into the gym . They 're going to jump `` me '' . Get out of there ! No , not me . The other me . The one on stage playing Johnny B. Goode . He could miss his opportunity to return ! We 'll have a major paradox ! Wait . A paradox ? One of those things that could destroy the universe ? You have to stop those guys without being seen by your other self . What the hell ? - Where is he ? - Who ? - Calvin Klein . - Who ? - The guy with the hat , where is he ? - He went that way . I think he took your wallet . I think he took his wallet . I guess you guys are n't ready for that yet ... but your kids are going to love it . Doc , success . Everything 's cool . Great . I 'll be landing at the roof in one minute . I 'll be there . Marty , that was very interesting music . I hope you do n't mind . George asked to take me home . Yeah . Great . Great . I had a feeling about you two . I had a feeling , too . Hey butthead ! You think that stupid disguise can get by me ? Let 's have it out . You and me , right now . No , thanks . What 's the matter ? Where are you going ? Are you chicken ? That 's it , is n't it ? Nothing but a little chicken . Nobody calls me a ... What the hell ... You steal my stuff ? And this one 's for my car ! Doc ! I blew it . Biff nailed me . He took the book . He drove away with it in his car . It 's my fault . I should have left sooner . - No time for that . Where did he go ? - To the River Road Tunnel . Get in ! Yes ! There he is , Doc ! - Let 's land on him and cripple his car . - That 's a '46 Ford . We 're a DeLorean . He 'll rip us like tin foil . - So what do we do ? - I have a plan . Repeating tonight 's weather bulletin , a thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley . Serving Hill Valley and Hill County ... you 're tuned to KKHV , the voice of Hill Valley . Turning to community calendar , the Hill Valley Women 's Club bake sale ... will be held tomorrow from 2:00 to 5:00 ... at the community center on Forest Road .

I hate manure ! Doc , is everything all right ? Over . It 's very miserable flying weather ... much too turbulent for a landing from this direction . I 'll have to approach from the south . Have you got the book ? In my hand , Doc ! I got it in my hand ! Burn it ! Check ! Doc ! The newspaper changed . Doc , my father 's alive ! That means everything's back to normal , right ? Mission accomplished . That means Jennifer 's okay and Einie 's okay , right ? That 's right , Marty . It 's the ripple effect . The future is back , so let 's go home . Right . Let 's get our asses back to the ... Doc , are you okay ? That was a close one . I almost bought the farm . Well , be careful . You do n't want to get struck by lightning . Doc , come in , Doc . Doc , do you read me ? Do you read me , Doc ? Come in . He 's gone . The Doc 's gone . Is your name Marty McFly ? I 've got something for you . A letter . A letter for me ? That 's impossible . - Who the hell are you ? - Western Union . Many of us at the office were hoping you could shed some light on the subject . We 've had that envelope in our possession ... for the past 70 years . It was given to us with the explicit instructions ... that it be delivered to a young man with your description ... answering to the name of Marty at this exact location ... at this exact minute , November 12 , 1955 . We had a bet going on whether this Marty would actually be here . Looks like I lost . Did you say 70 years ? Yes . 70 years , 2 months , 12 days , to be exact . Sign on line 6 , please . Here you are . It 's from the Doc ! `` Dear Marty , if my calculations are correct ... '' you will receive this letter immediately after the DeLorean 's struck by lightning . `` First let me assure you I 'm alive and well . `` I 've been living happily these past 8 months in the year 1885 . `` The lightning bolt ... '' September , 1885 . '' Wait , kid ! Wait a minute . What 's this all about ? He 's alive ! The Doc 's alive ! - He 's in the Old West , but he 's alive . - Kid , you all right ? Need any help ? There 's only one man who can help me . Relax , Doc . It 's me . It 's me ! It 's Marty . Impossible . I sent you back to the future . I know , you did send me back ... but I 'm back . I 'm back from the future . Great Scott ! Doc , Doc , wake up ! TO BE CONTINUED ... That 's right , Tannen ! Come on , runt ! You can dance better than that !
1985;How about a ride , mister ? Jennifer . Man , are you a sight for sore eyes . Let me look at you . Marty , you 're acting like you have n't seen me in a week . I have n't . Are you okay ? Is everything all right ? Everything 's great . You 've got to come back with me . - Where ? - Back to the future . - Wait . What are you doing , Doc ? - I need fuel . Go ahead . Quick . Get in the car . No . Look , Doc , I just got here . Jennifer 's here . We 're going to take the new truck for a spin . Bring her along . This concerns her , too . Wait . What are you talking about ? What happens to us in the future ? Do we become assholes or something ? No . You and Jennifer both turn out fine . It 's your kids , Marty . Something 's got to be done about them . Doc , you better back up . We do n't have enough road to get up to 88 . Roads ? Where we 're going , we do n't need roads . Say , Marty ! Marty , I wanted to show you these new matchbooks ... for my auto detailing I had printed up . A flying DeLorean ? What the hell is going on here ? OPENING CREDITS - What the hell was that ? - Taxicab . - Taxicab ? I thought we were flying . - Precisely . All right , Doc . What 's going on ? Where are we ? When are we ? We 're descending toward Hill Valley , California ... at 4:29 p.m ... on Wednesday , October 21 , 2015 . You mean we 're in the future . What do you mean ? How can we be in the future ? I do n't know how to tell you this , but ... you 're in a time machine . - And this is the year 2015 ? - October 21 , 2015 . God , so , like , you were n't kidding . Marty , we can actually see our future . You said we were married , right ? - Yeah ... - Yeah ? Was it a big wedding ? - We 're going to see our wedding ! - Wow . - I 'll see my wedding dress . - Wow . I wonder where we live . I bet it 's a big house with lots of kids . How many kids ... - Doc ! What the hell are you doing ? - Relax . It 's a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator . No one should know too much about their future . When she wakes up , she 'll think it was a dream . - What did you bring her for ? - I had to do something . She saw the time machine . I couldn't leave her with that information . Do n't worry . She 's not essential to my plan . Well , you 're the doc , Doc . Here 's our exit . You 've got to get out and change clothes . Right now ? It 's pouring rain . Wait five more seconds . Right on the tick . Amazing . Absolutely amazing . Too bad the post office isn't as efficient as the weather service . Excuse the disguise , but I was afraid you would n't recognize me . I went to a rejuvenation clinic and got a whole natural overhaul . Took out some wrinkles , did a hair repair , changed the blood ... added 30 or 40 years to my life . They also replaced my spleen and colon . What do you think ? You look great , Doc . The future . Unbelievable . - I got to check this out , Doc . - All in good time . - We 're on a tight schedule . - Tell me about my future . Do I become , like , a rich rock star ? No one should know too much about their destiny . - I am rich , though , right ? - Marty , please , take off your shirt . Put on the jacket and the shoes . Got a mission to accomplish . Precisely on schedule . Power laces . All right . This thing does n't fit . Size-adjusting fit . Pull out your pants pockets . All kids here wear their pants inside out . Put on this cap . Perfect . You 're the spitting image of your future son . - What ? - Help me move Jennifer over here . - So what 's the deal ? - Grab her feet . Okay , now what ? In exactly two minutes , you go around the corner into the Caf '80s . Caf '80s ? It 's one of those nostalgia places , but not done well . Go in and order a Pepsi . Here 's $ 50 . Wait for a guy named Griff . Right . Griff . Griff 's going to ask about tonight . Are you in or out ? Tell him you are out . Whatever he says , say no , you 're not interested . Then leave , come back here and wait for me . Do n't talk to anyone . Do n't touch anything . Do n't do anything . Do n't interact with anyone ... and try not to look at anything . I do n't get it . - You said this had to do with my kids . - Look what happens to your son . My son ? God , he looks just like me . `` Within two hours of his arrest , Martin McFly Jr ... was tried , convicted , and sentenced to 15 years in the state penitentiary '' ? Within two hours ? The justice system works swiftly now that they 've abolished lawyers . This is heavy . It gets worse . Your daughter tries to break him out and gets sent up for 20 years . My daughter . I have a daughter ? This one event starts a chain reaction that destroys your entire family . Doc , this date ... This is tomorrow 's newspaper . Precisely .

You 're Marty McFly 's kid , are n't you ? - Biff ? - You 're Marty Jr. Tough break , kid . Must be rough being named after a complete butthead . What 's that mean ? Hello . Hello . Anybody home ? Think , McFly , think ! Your old man ? Mr. Loser ? - What ? - That 's right . Loser with a capital `` L '' . Look , I happen to know George McFly is ... I 'm not talking about George McFly . I 'm talking about his kid . Your old man , Marty McFly Sr. ? The man who took his life and flushed it completely down the toilet . I did ? I mean , he did ? Hey , Gramps ...

He 's a complete wimp . What 's it going to be , McFly ? Are you in or out ? I just , I 'm not sure that I should . I should discuss it with my father . Your father ? Wrong answer , McFly !

I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season , bet on the Cubbies ! This has an interesting feature . It has a dust jacket . Books had these to protect the covers . That was before dust-repellent paper . If you 're interested in dust , we have something from the 1980s ... called a Dustbuster . - I ca n't lose . - Up here ! - Doc , what 's going on ? - Stand by . I 'll park over there . Yeah , all right . Hey , right on time . Flying DeLorean ? I have n't seen one in 30 years . Sorry . Excuse me . Sorry . I 'm walking here ! I 'm walking here ! - What the hell ? - Do n't drive trank , low-res scuzzball ! Two of them ? I left him in a suspended animation kennel . Einstein never knew I was gone ! What in the name of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here ? Doc , my kid showed up . All hell broke loose . Your kid ? Great Scott , I was afraid of this . I used it on Jennifer . There was n't enough power left to knock your son out . Doc , look at this ! It 's changing . I was framed ! Yes ! Yes , of course ! Because this hoverboard incident occurred , Griff goes to jail . Your son wo n't go with him tonight . That robbery wo n't take place ! History , future history , has been altered , and this is proof ! We 've succeeded , not as planned , but no matter . Let 's get Jennifer and go home ! Hi , Einie . Hi , buddy . - What 's this ? - A souvenir . `` 50 years of sports statistics '' . Hardly recreational reading material . Doc , what 's the harm in bringing back some info on the future ? We could place some bets . I did n't invent the time machine for financial gain ! The intent is to gain a clearer perception of humanity . Our past , our future , the pitfalls , the possibilities ... the perils , and the promise . Perhaps an answer to that universal question , `` Why ? '' I 'm all for that . What 's wrong with making a few bucks on the side ? I am going to put this in the trash . Great Scott ! McFly , Jennifer Jane Parker , Hilldale , age 47 . - What 's happening ? - They used her thumbprint to assess her ID . Since thumbprints never change , they assume she 's the future Jennifer . We got to stop them . How ? Tell them we 're time travelers ? They 'd have us committed . She 's clean . We take her home . To Hilldale ? We wo n't get there before dark . They 're taking her to your future home ! We 'll arrive shortly thereafter , get her , and return to 1985 . I 'll see where I live . See myself as an old man ? No , that could result in ... Great Scott ! Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self ! The consequences could be disastrous ! - What do you mean ? - I foresee two possibilities . One , seeing herself 30 years older would put her into shock , and she 'd pass out ... or two , the encounter could create a time paradox ... and cause a chain reaction that would unravel ... the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe ! Granted , that 's a worst-case scenario . The destruction might be localized , limited to our own galaxy . Well , that 's a relief . Let 's go and find Jennifer before she finds herself . The skyway 's jammed . It 'll take forever to get there . And this stays here ! I did n't invent the time machine to win at gambling , but to travel through time ! I know . So , Doc Brown invented a time machine . Hilldale . Nothing but a breeding ground for tranks , lobos , and zipheads . Yeah , they ought to tear this whole place down . Welcome home , Jennifer . You got a little tranked , but I think you can walk . Ma'am , you should reprogram . It 's dangerous in the dark . - Lights on ? - Yes . Now , look . Just take it easy , and you 'll be fine . And be careful in the future . The future ? Have a nice day , Mrs. McFly . Broadcasting beautiful views You 're tuned to the Scenery Channel . I 'm in the future . I get married in the Chapel O Love ? Mom ? Mom , is that you ? I got to get out of here ! Mom ? Mom , is that you ? - Grandma ! - Sweetheart ! - What happened to Grandpa ? - He threw his back out again . - How 's Granddad 's little pumpkin ? - How did you do that ? Out on the golf course . Are your folks home yet ? I brought pizza ! - Who 's going to eat all that ? - I will . Damn this traffic ! Jennifer , old Jennifer gets home around now . I hope we 're not too late . - What is it ? What 's the matter , Doc ? - I thought I saw a taxi . I thought it was following us . I ca n't believe this window 's still broken . When the repairman called Daddy a chicken ... Daddy threw him out of the house . Now nobody will fix it . Look how worn out this is . Your father 's biggest problem is that he loses all self-control ... when someone calls him chicken . How often have we heard it ? `` Mom , I ca n't let him think I 'm chicken '' . You 're right . Well , you 're right ! About 30 years ago , your father tried to prove he was n't chicken . He ended up in an automobile accident . With the Rolls-Royce ? Automobile accident . All right , Einie , let 's find Jennifer . I live in Hilldale ? This is great ! Stay here , change clothes . If I need you , I 'll holler . I want to check out my house . We ca n't risk you running into your older self . Einie , let 's go . Hilldale . This is bitchin ' . One , seven , four point five zero . - That will be $ 174.50 . - Here . Be careful in this neighborhood . - Where 's my receipt ? - Right here . How about a tip ? That accident caused a chain reaction , sending Marty 's life down the tubes . Otherwise , your father 's life would have turned out differently . The man would n't have pressed charges ... Marty would n't have broken his hand , given up on his music ... and spent years feeling sorry for himself . Hey , Mom , nice pants . The reason your mother married him ... Mom ? Turn off .

We 're like a couple of teenagers . Dad , telephone . It 's Needles . Dad , it 's for you . All right . Well , I 'll take that in the den . Retract . Hello . In here , please . Hey , the big M. How 's it hanging , McFly ? Hey , Needles . Needles ? Did you look at my little business proposal ? - I do n't know . - Why are you worried ? If this works , your financial problems are solved . And if it does n't work , Needles , I could get fired . It 's illegal . I mean , what if the Jits is monitoring ? - The Jits will never find out . - God . Come on . Stick your card in the slot , and I 'll handle it . Unless you want everyone in the division to think you 're chicken . Nobody calls me chicken , Needles . - Nobody ! - All right . Prove it . All right . All right , Needles . Here 's my card . Scan it . I 'm in . Thanks , McFly . I 'll see you at the plant tomorrow . Shit . Fujitsu-san . I was monitoring that scan you just interfaced . You are terminated ! Terminated . No ! It was n't my fault , sir . - Needles was behind it . - And you cooperated . It was a sting operation . I was setting him up . Read my fax ! No ! Please ! I can not be fired . I 'm fired . This is heavy . What am I going to tell Jennifer ? Doc . Am I glad to see you . Go out the front door . I 'll meet you there . But it does n't open . There 's no doorknob . Press your thumb to the plate . What plate ? What does this fax mean ? Mom . It 's a joke , an office joke . It 's a joke fax . - I heard you yell . - Calm down . I was n't yelling . Needles and I were just joking . Welcome home , Jennifer . Lost my job , Mom ? Get out of town . - I 'm young ! - I 'm old ! Marty , come quick ! Quick ! She encountered her older self and went into shock . She 'll be fine . Let 's get her back to 1985 . Then I 'll destroy the time machine . Destroy it ? What about that stuff about humanity and where we 're going ? The risks are too great , as this incident proves . And I was behaving responsibly . Imagine if the time machine fell into the wrong hands ? My only regret ... is that I 'll never get a chance to visit my favorite historical era ... the Old West . But time traveling is just too dangerous . Better that I devote myself to study ... the other great mystery of the universe : Women . Marty , Einie , brace yourselves for temporal displacement . Did we make it ? Are we back ? We 're back . Let 's put her in the swing . You can return in your truck and wake her . When she awakens here in her own house ... you can convince her it was a dream . We 're just leaving her here ? Disorientation will help convince her it was a dream . How long will she be out ? I 'm not quite sure . She received quite a shock . Could be a few minutes , probably a couple of hours . - You better bring smelling salts . - You 're the doc , Doc . Come on . Let 's go , Einie . Do n't worry . She 'll be fine . I do n't remember bars being on these windows . If you need me , I 'll be in my lab dismantling this thing . Right . What the hell ? Wait a minute . What are you doing in my room ? - Rape ! Mom ! - Okay . Okay . - Dad , help ! - Freeze , sucker ! - I do n't want any trouble . - You got trouble now , you piece of trash . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm in the wrong house . You got that right , you son of a ... - Look . I made a mistake . - Damned right you made a mistake ! I 'm going to tear your ass up ! That 's right . You keep running , sucker ! Tell that realty company I ai n't selling ! We wo n't be terrorized ! This has got to be the wrong year . - It ca n't be . - Drop it . So you 're the son of a bitch who 's been stealing my papers . Mr. Strickland . - Mr. Strickland . It 's me , sir . Marty . - Who ? Martin McFly . Do n't you know me from school ? I 've never seen you before in my life , but you look like a slacker . Yeah , that 's right . I am a slacker . - You gave me detention last week . - The school burned down six years ago . You have three seconds to get off my porch with your nuts intact . - One . - I just want to know what 's going on . Two . Strickland ! Eat lead , slackers !

Third time 's the charm . - No ! - Come with us upstairs . - Let me go . - We can do this the easy way or the hard way . The easy way . - Mom ? Mom , is that you ? - Just relax , Marty . You 've been asleep for almost two hours . I had a horrible nightmare . It was terrible . Well , you 're safe and sound now , back on the good old 27th floor . Mom ? Mom , that ca n't be you . Well , yes , it 's me , Marty . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . It 's just that you 're so ... You 're so ... big . Everything 's going to be fine , Marty . Are you hungry ?

You got kicked out of another boarding school ? Do you know how much dough I 've blown on your no-good kids ? What the hell do you care ? We can afford it . The least we can do with that money is provide a better life for our children . Hold on . Let 's get this straight . Marty is your kid , not mine . All the world 's money would n't help that lazy bum . Stop it , Biff . Just stop it . Look at him . He 's a butthead , just like his old man was . Do n't you dare speak that way about George . You 're not even half the man he was . You son of a bitch ! Always the little hothead ? You want to take a poke at me ? Damn it , Biff . That 's it . I 'm leaving . So go ahead . Think about this , Lorraine ! Who 's going to pay for your clothes ? And your jewelry and liquor ? Who 's going to pay for your cosmetic surgery ? You were the one who wanted me to get these things .

As for you , I 'll be back up here in an hour , so you better not be . He was right , and I was wrong . Mom , what 're you saying ? You 're actually defending him . I had it coming . He 's my husband , and he takes care of all of us ... - and he deserves our respect . - Respect ? Your husband ! How could he be your husband ? - How could you leave Dad for him ? - Leave Dad ? - Marty , are you feeling all right ? - No , I 'm not feeling all right ! I do n't understand what 's going on here . Why nobody can give me a simple , straight answer . They must have hit you over the head hard this time . Mom , I just want to know one thing . Where 's my father ? Where 's George McFly ? George , your father , is in the same place he 's been for the past 12 years . Oak Park Cemetery . No ! This ca n't be happening ! `` March 15 , 1973 '' . No ! Please , God , no ! No , please , God . Please , God , no . This ca n't be happening . This ca n't be happening . This ca n't be ... I 'm afraid it is happening . All of it . When I learned about your father , I figured you 'd come here . Then you know what happened to him ? Do you know what happened ... March 15 , 1973 ? Yes , Marty . I know . I went to the public library to make sense of the madness . The place was boarded up . I broke in and borrowed newspapers . I do n't get it , Doc . How can all this be happening ? It 's like we 're in Hell or something . No , it 's Hill Valley , although I ca n't imagine Hell being much worse . Einie . I 'm sorry , boy . The lab is an awful , awful mess . Attaboy . Obviously , the time continuum has been disrupted ... creating this new temporal event sequence ... - resulting in this alternate reality . - English , Doc . Here , here . Let me illustrate . Imagine that this line represents time . Here 's the present , 1985 , the future , and the past . Prior to this point in time , somewhere in the past ... the time line skewed into this tangent ... creating an alternate 1985 . Alternate to you , me , and Einstein ... but reality for everyone else . Recognize this ? It 's the bag the sports book came in . I know , because the receipt was still inside . I found them in the time machine , along with this . It 's the top of Biff 's cane . I mean old Biff , from the future . Correct . It was in the time machine because Biff was in the time machine ... with the Sports Almanac . Holy shit . You see , while we were in the future ... Biff got the sports book , stole the time machine , went back in time ... and gave the book to himself at some point in the past . Look . It says right here ... that Biff made his first $ 1,000,000 betting on a horserace in 1958 . He was n't just lucky . He knew , because he had the race results in the Sports Almanac . That 's how he made his entire fortune . Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass . The Almanac . Son of a bitch stole my idea . He must have been listening when I ... It 's my fault . The whole thing is my fault . If I had n't bought that damn book ... none of this would have happened . - It 's all in the past . - The future . Whatever . It demonstrates precisely how time travel can be misused ... and why the time machine must be destroyed ... after we straighten all of this out . Right . So we go back to the future ... and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine . We ca n't , because if we travel into the future from this point in time ... it will be the future of this reality ... in which Biff is corrupt and powerful ... and married to your mother , and in which ... this has happened to me . No . Our only chance to repair the present is in the past ... at the point where the time line skewed into this tangent . In order to put the universe back as we remember it ... and get back to our reality , we have to find out the exact date ... and the specific circumstances of how , where , and when ... young Biff got his hands on that `` Sports Almanac '' . I 'll ask him . Bulletproof vest ! Great flick ! Great frigging flick ! The guy is brilliant . What the hell 's going ... - What the hell are you doing in here ? - Party 's over , Biff . Sorry , ladies . How did you get past my security downstairs ? There 's a matter we need to talk about . - Yeah . Money , right ? Well , forget it . - No . Not money . Gray 's Sports Almanac . You heard him , girls . Party 's over . Start talking , kid . What else do you know about that book ? First you tell me how you got it . How , where , and when . All right . Take a seat . Sit down ! November 12 , 1955 . That was when . November 12 , 1955 . That was the date I went back ... That was the date of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm . You know your history . Very good . I 'll never forget that Saturday . I 'd picked my car up from the shop because I 'd rolled it in a drag race . I thought you crashed into a manure truck . How do you know about that ? My father told me about it . Your father ? Before he died . Yeah . Right . So there I was , minding my own business . This crazy old codger with a cane shows up . He says he 's my distant relative . I do n't see any resemblance . So he says , '' How would you like to be rich ? '' So I said , `` Sure '' . So he lays this book on me . He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event this century . All I have to do is bet on the winner and I 'll never lose . So I said , `` What 's the catch ? '' He says , '' No catch . Just keep it a secret . '' After that , he disappeared . I never saw him again . He told me one more thing . He said , `` Someday a crazy , wild-eyed scientist ... '' or a kid may show up asking about that book . `` And if that ever happens ... Funny . I never thought it would be you . Biff , you 're forgetting one thing . What the hell is that ? You 're dead , you little son of a bitch ! - There he is ! - Wait , kid ! Hurry ! There he is ! Go ahead , kid . Jump . A suicide will be nice and neat . What if I do n't ? Lead poisoning . What about the police , Biff ? They 're going to match the bullet with that gun . Kid , I own the police . Besides , they could n't match up the bullet that killed your old man . You son of a ... I suppose it 's poetic justice . Two McFlys with the same gun . Idiot . What the hell ... Nice job , Doc ! You 're not going to believe this . We 've got to go back to 1955 . I do n't believe it . That 's right , Doc . November 12 , 1955 . Unbelievable that old Biff could 've chosen that particular date . It could mean that that point in time contains some cosmic significance ... as if it were the temporal junction point of the entire space-time continuum ... or it could just be an amazing coincidence . Damn ! Got to fix that thing . All right . Time circuits on . What do you mean , time circuits on ? Doc , we 're not going back now . What about Jennifer ? Einstein ? We ca n't leave them . Do n't worry . Assuming we succeed on our mission ... this alternate 1985 will be changed into the real 1985 ... instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie . Jennifer and Einie will be fine . They 'll have no memory of this horrible place . - What if we do n't succeed ? - We must succeed . This is heavy , Doc . It 's like I was here yesterday . You were here yesterday , Marty . Amazing , is n't it ? Sunrise should be in about 22 minutes . You go into town . Track down young Biff and tail him . Sometime today , old Biff will show up to give young Biff the Almanac . Above all you must not interfere . Let old Biff believe he 's succeeded so he 'll leave 1955 ... - and bring the DeLorean to the future . - Right . Once old Biff is gone , grab the Almanac anyway that you can . - Remember , our futures depend on this . - You do n't have to remind me of that . Here 's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie to keep in contact . I 'll stay and repair the short in the time circuit . That way , we do n't risk anyone else stealing the time machine ... and I wo n't risk accidentally running into my other self . - Other self ? - Yes . There are now two of me here ... and there are two of you here . The other me is the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955 . The other me that helps the other you get back to 1985 . Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower ? That does n't happen until tonight . Be careful not to run into your other self . Let me give you some money . Have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities . - Get yourself some '50s clothes . - Check , Doc . Something inconspicuous . Doc . Come in . This is Marty . Over . - Roger , this is Doc . Are you there ? - Yeah , Doc . I 'm at the address . It 's the only Tannen in the book , but I do n't think this is Biff 's house . It looks like an old lady lives here . - Where are you going , Biff ? - I 'm going to get my car , Grandma . When are you coming back ? I want you to rub my toes . Shut up , you old bag . Give us our ball back . - What ball ? - That ball ! What are you talking about ? Give us our ball ! Ball ? - Is this your ball ? - Yeah ! - You want it back ? - Yeah . Go get it . Doc , it is Biff 's house . I 'm on him . Over . She 's all fixed up , but I could n't get her started . - Got a kill switch ? - You just need the right touch . Nobody can start this car but me . - The bill comes to $ 302.57 . - $ 300 ? $ 300 for a couple of dents ? That 's bullshit . It was horseshit . The whole car was horseshit . - Jones wanted $ 80 to haul it away . - I bet he resold it . - I got to get something . - You want something ? You can call Jones and if he wants to give you a refund ... $ 300 ! If I catch the guy that caused this I 'll break his neck . The manure . I remember that . - 4 cans for a $ 300 job ? - I ca n't have lunch in there . - Makes me nauseous . - I should get a case for $ 300 . It smells worse than the bathroom . The stench is never going to go away , Biff . Last time I do you a favor . Last time . It 's perfect , Lorraine . You 're going to look so good ! You 're going to look ... Look at what we have here . Nice dress , Lorraine . Although I think you 'd look better wearing nothing . - Take a long walk off a short pier . - There 's that dance at school tonight . Now that my car 's fixed ... I 'll give you the honor of going with the best-looking guy in school . I 'm busy . - Doing what ? - Washing my hair . That 's as funny as a screen door on a battleship . Screen door on a submarine , you dork . Biff , somebody already asked me to the dance . Who ? That bug George McFly ? - I 'm going with Calvin Klein , okay ? - Calvin Klein ? No , it 's not okay . - You 're going with me , understand ? - Get your cooties off me ! When will you get it through your skull ? You 're my girl . I would n't be your girl even if you had a million dollars ! Yes , you will ! It 's you and me , Lorraine . Watch it ! It 's meant to be . I 'm going to marry you someday , Lorraine . Someday you 'll be my wife ! You always did have a way with women . Get the hell out of my car , old man . You want to marry that girl ? I can help make it happen . - Who are you , Miss Lonely-hearts ? - Just get in the car , butthead . Who are you calling butthead , butthead ? How did you do that ? Nobody can start this car but me . Get in the car , Tannen . Today 's your lucky day . Watch where you 're driving , old man . If you dent this car , I 'll kill you . - This cost me $ 300 ! - Would you shut up about the car ? - How do you know where I live ? - Let 's just say we 're related , Biff . That being the case , I got a present for you . Something that 'll make you rich . - You want to be rich , do n't you ? - Yeah . Sure . Right . That 's rich . You 're going to make me rich ? You see this book ? This book tells the future . Tells the results of every major sports event till the end of this century . Football , baseball , horseraces , boxing . The information in here is worth millions , and I 'm giving it to you . That 's very nice . Thank you very much . Now , why do n't you make like a tree and get out of here ? It 's leave , you idiot . Make like a tree and leave . You sound like a fool when you say it wrong . All right , leave . And take your book with you . Do n't you get it ? You could make a fortune with this book . Let me show you . UCLA trails 17-16 . It 's 4th and 11 with only 18 seconds left of this game . I 'd say it 's all over for UCLA . Bet you a million bucks UCLA wins it 19-17 . - Are you deaf ? It 's over . You lost . - Yeah ? Here comes Decker with the kick . It 's up and looks good . Ball 's in the clear . Field goall UCLA wins 19-17 . Listen to that Coliseum crowd go wild . Jim Decker ... All right . What 's the gag ? How did you know what the score would be ? I told you , it 's in this book . All you got to do is bet on the winner , and you 'll never lose . All right . I 'll take a look at it . You damn fool ! Never leave this book laying around . Do n't you have a safe ? No , you do n't have a safe . Get a safe . Keep it locked up . Until then , keep it on you . - What are you doing ? - Do n't tell anybody , either . There 's one more thing . One day , a kid or a crazy old man ... who claims to be a scientist is going to come around asking ... I 'm trapped . Doc . Doc , come in . - What 's the report ? - Biff 's gone . He 's got the book . I 'm locked in Biff 's garage . Get me the hell out of here . I 'm at 1809 Mason Street . I ca n't take the DeLorean . Do n't worry . Somehow I 'll get there . Doc , wait a minute . Doc . Doc . Perfect . Biff ! Where are you going now ? I told you , Grandma , I 'm going to the dance . - When you coming home ? - The dance . I 'll get home when I get home . Do n't forget to turn out the garage light . Marty , Marty . Damn ! Where is that kid ? Doc . Doc , come in . Come in , Doc . Marty ! Come in . My ... Great Scott . My God . Doc , Doc , come in . Marty , what happened ? You were n't at Biff 's house . - I 'm in Biff 's car , heading for the Enchantment Under The Sea dance . We may have to abort this entire plan . It 's getting much too dangerous . The book 's on his dashboard . I 'll grab it when we arrive . You must be careful not to run into your other self . - My other self ? - Yes . Remember your mother is at that exact same dance with you . - Right . This could get heavy , Doc . - Heavy , heavy . Whatever happens , do n't let your other self see you ! - The consequences could be disastrous . - Excuse me , sir . Yes , you with the hat . - Who , me ? - Yes . Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths inch wrench from the toolbox . Five-eighths ? Do n't you mean three-quarters ? Why , you 're right . I presume you 're conducting some sort of weather experiment . That 's right . How did you know that ? I happen to have had a little experience in this area . I 'm hoping to see some lightning tonight ... although the weatherman says there 's no chance of rain . There 's going to be plenty of rain . Wind , thunder , lightning . - It 's going to be one hell of a storm . - Thanks . Nice talking to you . Maybe we 'll bump into each other again in the future . Or in the past . Doc , Doc ! Come in ! Where 's that punk Calvin Klein , anyway ? I do n't know . I ai n't his secretary . Well , find him . He caused me $ 300 damage . I owe him a knuckle sandwich . Get going ! - Are n't you coming ? - I 'm reading . Well , well , Mr. Tannen . How nice to see you here . - Mr. Strickland , nice to see you , sir . - Is that liquor I smell , Tannen ? I would n't know . I do n't know what it smells like because I 'm too young to drink it . I see . What have we here ? Sports stats , interesting subject . Homework , Tannen ? No , it ai n't homework , because , I ai n't at home . You got a real attitude problem , you know ? One day I 'll have you where I want you , in detention . Slacker ! Jesus , you smoke , too ? Marty , you sound just like my mother . Yeah , right . When I have kids , I 'll let them do anything they want . Anything at all . - I 'd like to have that in writing . - Yeah , me , too . Marty , why are you so nervous ? Yes ! `` Oh LL '' ? - Doc ! Doc ! - Hey , you . - Doc , come in ! - Marty , what 's up ? Doc ! I 'm in trouble . I blew it . - Where 's the book ? - Biff must have it . - I 've only got the cover . - Where 's Biff ? - You 're asking for it . - I do n't know . - Any idea ? - No ! He could be anywhere by now . The entire future depends on you getting that book ! - I know . I just do n't ... - Stop it ! Stop it , Biff . You 'll break his arm . Stop it ! Of course ! I got ta go . I got one chance ! My old man is about to deck Biff ! Yes ! Talk about dj vu . Are you okay ? Okay , everybody , let 's back up . Everybody just back up . Give him a little bit of room . It 's okay . I know CPR . I know CPR . - What 's CPR ? - You ! - He 's fine . - Did you just take his wallet ? He took that guy 's wallet . Doc , success . I got it . Thank goodness . Great , Marty . As soon as I reload the fusion generator we 'll meet on the roof of the school gym . On the roof . 10-4 . - It 's him ! - He 's in disguise . Guys , what 's that ? Come on ! Let 's get him ! Damn ! All right ! Let 's do another . Where did he go ? He just came in here ! - Look ! How did he get on stage ? - When he 's through , we 'll nail him . How did he change his clothes so fast ? It 's an oldie where I come from . All right , guys , blues riff in B . Watch me for the changes , and try and keep up , okay ? Doc , come in ! Come in . Listen , Biff 's guys chased me into the gym . They 're going to jump `` me '' . Get out of there ! No , not me . The other me . The one on stage playing Johnny B. Goode . He could miss his opportunity to return ! We 'll have a major paradox ! Wait . A paradox ? One of those things that could destroy the universe ? You have to stop those guys without being seen by your other self . What the hell ? - Where is he ? - Who ? - Calvin Klein . - Who ? - The guy with the hat , where is he ? - He went that way . I think he took your wallet . I think he took his wallet . I guess you guys are n't ready for that yet ... but your kids are going to love it . Doc , success . Everything 's cool . Great . I 'll be landing at the roof in one minute . I 'll be there . Marty , that was very interesting music . I hope you do n't mind . George asked to take me home . Yeah . Great . Great . I had a feeling about you two . I had a feeling , too . Hey butthead ! You think that stupid disguise can get by me ? Let 's have it out . You and me , right now . No , thanks . What 's the matter ? Where are you going ? Are you chicken ? That 's it , is n't it ? Nothing but a little chicken . Nobody calls me a ... What the hell ... You steal my stuff ? And this one 's for my car ! Doc ! I blew it . Biff nailed me . He took the book . He drove away with it in his car . It 's my fault . I should have left sooner . - No time for that . Where did he go ? - To the River Road Tunnel . Get in ! Yes ! There he is , Doc ! - Let 's land on him and cripple his car . - That 's a '46 Ford . We 're a DeLorean . He 'll rip us like tin foil . - So what do we do ? - I have a plan . Repeating tonight 's weather bulletin , a thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley . Serving Hill Valley and Hill County ... you 're tuned to KKHV , the voice of Hill Valley . Turning to community calendar , the Hill Valley Women 's Club bake sale ... will be held tomorrow from 2:00 to 5:00 ... at the community center on Forest Road . For you sports fans , there was much action today in college football . Here 's what happened to the top 10 . UCLA narrowly defeated Washington 19-17 . Michigan State crushed Minnesota 42-14 . Ohio State beat Iowa 20-10 . - Michigan blanked Indiana 30-0 . - Shit . - It was Notre Dame over North Carolina ... - Son of a bitch . Oklahoma ripped Iowa State 52-0 . West Virginia lost to Pittsburgh 26-7 . Texas A & M over Rice 20-10 . Maryland defeated Clemson 25-12 ... and it was Texas Christian over Texas 47-20 . Repeating tonight 's earlier weather bulletin , a thundershower ... You again ? God ! Let it go ! Let go of this car ! That 'll teach him . Go , Doc ! Hold on , Marty ! Shit ! Yes ! Manure ! I hate manure ! Doc , is everything all right ? Over . It 's very miserable flying weather ... much too turbulent for a landing from this direction . I 'll have to approach from the south . Have you got the book ? In my hand , Doc ! I got it in my hand ! Burn it ! Check ! Doc ! The newspaper changed . Doc , my father 's alive ! That means everything's back to normal , right ? Mission accomplished . That means Jennifer 's okay and Einie 's okay , right ? That 's right , Marty . It 's the ripple effect . The future is back , so let 's go home . Right . Let 's get our asses back to the ... Doc , are you okay ? That was a close one . I almost bought the farm . Well , be careful . You do n't want to get struck by lightning . Doc , come in , Doc . Doc , do you read me ? Do you read me , Doc ? Come in . He 's gone . The Doc 's gone . Is your name Marty McFly ? I 've got something for you . A letter . A letter for me ?

2014;"THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING Written by Anthony McCarten SHOOTING SCRIPT NOVEMBER 2013 `` I now predict that I was wrong . '' STEPHEN HAWKING RUN OPENING TITLES OVER : INT . EMPIRE ROOM , BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY ( LATE 1980 'S ) TWO BESPECTACLED EYES . Blinking . Alert . Male . Middle-aged . Reflected in his shiny GLASSES - a WOMAN , middle-aged , ( JANE HAWKING ) removing the glasses from his nose . CUT TO : The MAN 's POV , as - - his vision goes from FOCUSED to BLURRY as the GLASSES are removed . - his BLURRY POV of the WOMAN 's hands POLISHING his glasses with a cloth . - his BLURRY POV then shifts ( as she steps aside ) onto a SMALL PERSON in the distance jumping up and down . - his BLURRY POV of the GLASSES then being replaced on his nose , and - - with this , his VISION comes abruptly into FOCUS , and the SMALL PERSON is revealed to be -- a BOY ( 10 ) playing HOPSCOTCH in the RED-CARPETED CORRIDOR . - Beyond the BOY , TWO RED-COATED EQUERRIES begin ( unceremoniously ) to prepare the HALLWAY for a ceremony . They lay out potted-plants and drape velvet ropes . One blows his nose . TIGHT ON : The eyes behind the glasses watching , his eyes finally looking downward ... as we hear a metallic CLICKING sound - `` CLICK , CLICK , CLICK ... '' - ANGLE ON : HIS HAND , which is clicking a CLICKER-PLATE ... - then on a COMPUTER MONITOR ( mounted to the CHAIR ) , words form out of a streaming alphabet with each 'CLICK ' . The man is at work , selecting LETTERS , then WHOLE WORDS from a MENU ... making sentences by these means . - OTHER PARTIAL VIEWS ( ECUs ) of this MAN in his WHEELCHAIR . We see ... a TUFT of BROWN HAIR ... his HAND on chair arm-rest ... his FEET on a wheelchair 's foot-rests ... JANE 's HANDS arrange the BROWN HAIR ... adjust his THIN ARMS ... but never do we see the full man , as - - the TWO EQUERRIES open TWO LARGE ORNATE DOORS and motion the PARTY forward . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 2 CONTINUED : TIGHT ON : the MAN 's HAND , pushing a TOGGLE-STICK CONTROLLER , putting the CHAIR in motion , to the sound of a small electric motor . END OPENING TITLES - TIGHT ON : The WHEELS of the WHEELCHAIR , turning ... MATCH CUT TO : EXT . CAMBRIDGE STREETS - DAY ( EARLY-MID 1960 's ) ... the FRONT WHEEL of STEPHEN 's BICYCLE , SPINNING VERY VERY FAST ... STEPHEN HAWKING ( in his early 20s ) and his friend , BRIAN ( same age ) , race each other recklessly through the NARROW , WINDING LANES . It looks VERY DANGEROUS . They are neck and neck . And they are loving it . STEPHEN HAWKING , his face almost entirely covered with spectacles and floppy hair , slight of frame , a velvet jacket and velvet bow tie , eccentric-looking . STEPHEN is a fun- loving , playful , active , young student . BRIAN , STEPHEN 's best friend . More interested in life than studies , as we shall see . EXT . STUDENT PARTY , CAMBRIDGE - DUSK STEPHEN and BRIAN arrive at the party , dismount at speed and , running to a walk , crash their BIKES into a HEDGE . BRIAN wins the race , raises arms aloft as - they enter the PARTY . We follow them in ... ( CONTINUOUS SHOT ) INT . STUDENT PARTY , CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ... STEPHEN and BRIAN enter , and the CAMERA finally follows them into the main room of the PARTY . STEPHEN and BRIAN come to a halt in the doorway as they OBSERVE - - a CROWDED ROOM engaged in lively bubbly conversation . In the background suitably elegant music plays . BRIAN First to find a drink . STEPHEN and BRIAN make their way through the GUESTS , looking for the BAR . BRIAN eyes the PRETTY GIRLS he passes ... ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 3 CONTINUED : BRIAN ( CONT 'D ) I 'm sure the secret of the universe has something to do with sex . There you go -- why do n't you do your doctorate on that ? The physics of love . STEPHEN More your field , I think . BRIAN You 'd better decide on your subject . I 'm serious -- they 'll boot you out . They reach the PUNCH-BOWL . BRIAN tastes the PUNCH with his finger , and UNIMPRESSED , fills TWO GLASSES . CUT TO : A YOUNG WOMAN , JANE WILDE , ( 18 ) arrives at the door with her friend DIANA . DIANA is unimpressed by the party . JANE , shy , has her hair up in a fashionable bouffant roll . DIANA is more vivacious , and touches up her lipstick . DIANA Scientists ! Do n't worry . We don't have to stay long . Looks mortifyingly dull . ( seeing a boy ) Oh , hang on -- ( waves to the boy ) Be right back , okay ? Okay ? JANE nods , as DIANA goes over to GREET the boy and then walk off together with him into the crowd . ANGLE ON : JANE , marooned . CUT TO : At the PUNCH-BOWL , drinking punch . STEPHEN I applied for a job . BRIAN Did you ? STEPHEN Civil Service . BRIAN Well , it 's a back-up plan -- in your case not a bad idea . Did they accept you ? ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 4 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) ANGLE ON : STEPHEN 's POV of JANE , standing across the room , now holding a WINE-GLASS . STEPHEN Unfortunately , that I 'll never know . Morning of their exam , I ... ( smiles ) BRIAN - slept in . Well , thank Christ , the world has lost a promising pay- clerk . BRIAN holds out a FULL PUNCH GLASS for STEPHEN but STEPHEN still has his eye on JANE . BRIAN follows STEPHEN 's GAZE as - - STEPHEN and JANE 's eyes meet . They hold this look , until she shyly looks away . BRIAN has observed this exchange . BRIAN ( CONT 'D ) ( LATIN ) Quo est femella ? STEPHEN I was going to ask you . BRIAN Actually -- I think she 's -- yes -- Basil 's sister . Wilde -- Jane Wilde . ( RUSSIAN ACCENT ) `` So . You like for me I introduce ? '' STEPHEN contemplates this , as we - CUT TO : DIANA changes the RECORD - to BOP JAZZ . GUESTS immediately take the DANCE-FLOOR and start DANCING . DIANA returns to JANE . DIANA That 's better . JANE Who is that guy ? DIANA ( looking at Stephen ) Oh . He 's strange , clever , goes on Ban The Bomb marches . ( spying another boy ) Oh , there 's David . Come on . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 5 CONTINUED : ( 3 ) DIANA goes over to DAVID , but JANE stays where she is . CUT TO : BRIAN walks off to talk to another GIRL , while - - STEPHEN , left alone , decides to slowly approach JANE . JANE has hardly touched her wine . STEPHEN has a beer . They look around the room together , and then - STEPHEN Hello . JANE Hello . STEPHEN Science ? JANE Arts . More silence . They look elsewhere . JANE ( CONT 'D ) So what do you- ? STEPHEN Cosmologist . I 'm a cosmologist . JANE What 's a cosmologist ? STEPHEN It 's a kind of religion -- for intelligent atheists . ( SUSPICIOUSLY ) You 're not religious , are you ? JANE C of E. Church of England . STEPHEN ( SIMULTANEOUSLY ) - England . ( SMILES CHEEKILY ) I suppose someone has to be . JANE is not sure whether to take offence . JANE So -- what do cosmologists worship then ? ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 6 CONTINUED : ( 4 ) STEPHEN ( GRINS ) A single unifying equation that explains everything in the universe . JANE ( AMUSED ) Really ? So what 's the equation ? STEPHEN smiles . STEPHEN That is the question . CUT TO : The NEEDLE on the RECORD PLAYER now drops onto a ROLLING STONES record - `` TIME IS ON OUR SIDE '' Few people remain at the party now . The tables are empty - the food is gone . The punch bowl is drained dry . DIANA is still talking to DAVID , laughing . ANGLE ON : JANE , now listening intently to STEPHEN . JANE Why did n't you stay at Oxford ? STEPHEN My finals papers were such a shambles the examiners called me in for a 'Viva ' and I told them - JANE What 's a viva ? STEPHEN A mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy . An interrogation . So I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree I 'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford , but if they gave me the 1st I needed to get into Cambridge , then they 'd never have to see me again . JANE They gave you the 1st . STEPHEN They gave me the 1st . JANE laughs . STEPHEN grins - it 's a GREAT GRIN , as - - DIANA approaches . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 7 CONTINUED : ( 5 ) DIANA This party is officially deceased ! Come on -- I 've fixed you up a ride home . DAVID and DAVID 's HANDSOME FRIEND wait by the door . JANE barely has time to speak before she is dragged away by DIANA . JANE Well , I hope you find your equation . STEPHEN stands there , forlorn . But then JANE returns , stuffs something in his hand , and then runs away . It 's a NAPKIN . On it - a PHONE NUMBER . He stares at it , delighted , so much so that he taps one foot . INT . SEMINAR ROOM/TRINITY HALL/CAMBRIDGE - DAY STEPHEN reads a CHESS BOOK that lies on his LAP out of sight under the table , while the professor , DR. DENNIS SCIAMA , ( LATE 30s ) , with a wicked smirk on his face , passes out a set of mathematical problems to BRIAN , CARTER , ELLIS , REES and several other YOUNG PHYSICISTS . SCIAMA A little challenge for you all , as you embark on your separate doctoral journeys - ( handing paper to STEPHEN ) - whatever they may be , Mr Hawking - STEPHEN looks up , winces , knowing he 's way behind schedule . SCIAMA ( CONT 'D ) Something to sort -- the men from the boys -- the wheat from the chaff -- the mesons from the pi-mesons -- the quarks from the quacks -- ten questions -- each more impregnable than the last . Good luck . You'll need it . Shall we say , Friday 3 o'clock ? BRIAN ( aside , gloomy , to STEPHEN ) This is going to hospitalize me . STEPHEN crumples the paper in his pocket and continues to read the CHESS BOOK as he shuffles out of the tutorial . EXT . QUAD/ TRINITY HALL / CAMBRIDGE UNI . - DAY BRIAN runs across the QUAD . THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 8 INT . STEPHEN 'S ROOM/DORM , CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY ( 1963 ) BRIAN knocks , enters , finds STEPHEN asleep in bed . BRIAN Oh come on , get up . How many have you got ? BRIAN goes to STEPHEN 's desk , looking through papers to find his answers . How many have you done ? STEPHEN Morning , Brian . BRIAN Afternoon , Stephen . Where are they ? Where are you hiding them ? Your answers . STEPHEN Brian , I have no idea what you're talking about . BRIAN How many of Sciama 's questions have you done ? STEPHEN None . BRIAN You liar ! STEPHEN I was going do them later . BRIAN Later ? You mean you have n't even started ? Beat . BRIAN ( CONT 'D ) Stephen , are you aware you have voluntarily embarked on a PHD in physics at one of the most prestigious colleges in England ? STEPHEN Yes . BRIAN Oh , good . Thought maybe you 'd slept through the induction or something . BRIAN starts to leave ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 9 CONTINUED : STEPHEN ( to Brian at the door ) Bri- ? BRIAN What ? STEPHEN Can you whip on some Wagner ? BRIAN Sod off . BRIAN exits , giving up on his pal . STEPHEN , hung-over , sits on his bed and yawns . He gets out of bed and turns on his ANCIENT TAPE-MACHINE . WAGNER starts to play , loudly . Later . Pouring milk into a cup of TEA , while listening to a TAPED RECORDING of `` THE RING CYCLE '' by Wagner , and still in his pyjamas , the dishevelled STEPHEN digs out the QUESTIONS from a pile of TRASH on his desk . First he finds all manner of chocolate wrappers , concert tickets , etc , until he finally settles down with a clean pad and a pencil . He looks at the clock . It reads -- 1:00PM . He sighs and looks out his window at teeming university life , as he ponders . He then starts to WRITE on a PAD , rapidly , effortlessly , the CALCULATIONS pouring out of him , his writing hand adroit and swift . Distracted , he then reaches for his TEA and clumsily KNOCKS THE CUP OVER . The tea washes over his only pad . He hurriedly wipes it off , but it 's too late . He looks around for another pad , but to no avail . INT . SEMINAR ROOM , TRINITY COLLEGE - DAY The PhD STUDENTS are gathered , minus STEPHEN as SCIAMA hands back the classes answers . SCIAMA ( PASSING PAPER ) John , this so illegible I 'm not quite sure how wrong it is -- I suspect very -- and Brian ... ( TOSSING PAPERS ) ... that 's just -- baffling . STEPHEN arrives late - SCIAMA ( CONT 'D ) Stephen , glad you could join us . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 10 CONTINUED : STEPHEN Sorry . STEPHEN sets TWO TRAIN TIMETABLES on the table . Others push the TIME-TABLES down the desk to SCIAMA , who picks them up . SCIAMA Train timetables ? Stephen , these are totally unacceptable -- they expired a month ago . Laughter . STEPHEN Sorry . It 's on the back . Had a little accident . SCIAMA turns them over and looks at them . TIGHT ON : the TIMETABLES , then are filled with tiny formulas and calculations . SCIAMA registers growing amazement , then looks up at STEPHEN - STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) I could only do nine . End on SCIAMA and fellow students reaction - startled , speechless , everyone staring at STEPHEN . SCIAMA Well ... I see ... well thank God . Well done Stephen . BRIAN ( SILENTLY MOUTHS ) Nine ? EXT . RIVER - DAY OARS powerfully cut the WATER as a TWO-BOAT PRACTICE RACE unfolds . The TWO CREWS are from the same CLUB . PAN DOWN one BOAT : EIGHT LARGE POWERFUL ROWERS , culminating in PETE , DAN , RAFF , BRIAN and finally the thin , boyish , STEPHEN , in the role of COX , facing the rowers , calling out the stroke-rate using a coxswain 's loud-hailer . STEPHEN Full , give me twenty - One , drive ! - Two , drive ! - Three , big legs ! - Four , press ! - Five , boom ! - Hook , send ! - Catch , big send ! - Hold at 32 ! - Big legs , Brian ! - Big legs !

BRIAN ( exhausted , speaks one word on each stroke ) You ! - complete ! - and ! - utter ! bastard ! INT . PUB ON RIVER - DAY Rowdy tables of graduates and undergraduates and rowers , males and females . Beer flows . Playing PINBALL are BRIAN , REES , ELLIS and CARTER . STEPHEN watches , drinking a beer , distracted . CARTER No , no , listen , listen , pay attention . A man enters a lift , wanting to go to the fiftieth floor but only gets as far as the 46th . Why ? BRIAN ( EXHAUSTED ) Erm - there was a naked girl in the lift . Collective groan . BRIAN is clipped around the ears . BRIAN ( CONT 'D ) Hey -- it 's the closest I 'll get to a unifying theory , leave me alone . ALL then silently ponder the RIDDLE . BRIAN , deep in thought himself , finally notices STEPHEN , bursting to provide the answer . BRIAN acts to SILENCE STEPHEN - BRIAN ( CONT 'D ) ( raising a finger ) Uh ! ! ! ELLIS No -- we give up . No idea . STEPHEN He was too short to reach the button for the fiftieth floor . STEPHEN rises , triumphant , as the others groan . BRIAN Okay , I 've got one . Okay , okay -- A naked girl enters a lift - ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 12 CONTINUED : STEPHEN , at the bar , opens JANE 's NAPKIN . Looks at the number . STEPHEN ( TO BARMAN ) Do you have change for the pay- phone ? BARMAN Sure . The BARMAN takes STEPHEN 's POUND and glances at the NAPKIN . BARMAN ( CONT 'D ) I 'd commit that number to memory if I were you . STEPHEN smiles - then glances at the mirror-backed bar . Reflected - a WOMAN who looks like JANE . Is he imagining this ? TIGHT ON : STEPHEN 's face : we see JANE 's reflection appear and disappear in the glass of his glasses as she crosses the room . The BARMAN 's voice is distant ... BARMAN ( CONT 'D ) Here you go ... STEPHEN snaps out of it - stares at the BARMAN holding out CHANGE - a smile DAWNING . BARMAN ( CONT 'D ) Sir ? Are you okay ? STEPHEN Uh - my napkin just walked in . CUT TO : JANE and DIANA and two other FRIENDS sit with TWO OTHER YOUNG MEN at a table . She looks reluctant and unhappy to be with them . As one YOUNG MAN pours them beers she hands her beer to someone else . And then - STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) Hi . STEPHEN is not afraid to stand in front of this crowd of Girls and Jocks and stare straight at JANE . The others fall silent and stare at STEPHEN , but JANE 's eyes light up . JANE Hello . REACTION : DIANA : Not impressed . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 13 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) STEPHEN What 's the probability ? JANE Reasonably low . ( TO OTHERS ) Uh - this is - Stephen . He smiles at her . The OTHERS look back and forth between JANE and STEPHEN . JANE perks up , interested . STEPHEN Croquet . Do you play croquet ? JANE ( INTERESTED ) Um . Not recently . STEPHEN Sunday morning ? JANE I 'm actually busy Sunday mornings . STEPHEN Oh . Of course . ( POINTING HEAVEN-WARD ) Him . STEPHEN turns and just walks away . JANE is perplexed , disappointed - stares at him , as do the others . INT . CORRIDOR/DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS ( DAMTP ) , CAMBRIDGE - DAY STEPHEN approaches SCIAMA 's office , plucks up his courage , and knocks - INT . SCIAMA 'S OFFICE/DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS ( DAMTP ) , CAMBRIDGE - DAY SCIAMA Stephen , come in . Sit down . Now -- we 're all rather concerned -- about your choice of subject . What it's going to be . STEPHEN I ca n't decide . SCIAMA Any ideas ? One of SCIAMA 's PENS sits precariously on the edge of the desk , and in shuffling papers , knocks it off . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 14 CONTINUED : The PEN rolls off the DESK and falls on the FLOOR in front of STEPHEN . STEPHEN stares at the PEN as it comes to a STOP . STEPHEN Umm -- No . SCIAMA studies him , rises , take a BIG OLD KEY from the desk drawer . SCIAMA Come with me . INT . CAVENDISH LAB , CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY SCIAMA shows STEPHEN the famous lab . SCIAMA This lab is where JJ Thomson discovered the electron , where Rutherford split the atom . One of the great rewards of this job is that you never know from where the next great leap forward is going to come , or from whom . SCIAMA takes out a pen and writes on a pad , tears it off and gives it to STEPHEN . SCIAMA ( CONT 'D ) Next Friday . I 'm taking a few graduates of merit to London , to attend a talk by the mathematician Roger Penrose . Come along if you're interested . ( EXITING ) Oh , and close the door as you leave . SCIAMA exits . STEPHEN looks around at the empty LAB . He goes to the BLACKBOARD , picks up a piece of CHALK , looks at the BLANK BOARD , but then puts the CHALK back down and then begins to study , with RAPT AWE , the ancient LABORATORY EQUIPMENT . EXT . ANGLICAN CHURCH STEPS - DAY STEPHEN is now sitting on a STONE WALL , waiting as - - the WILDES emerge , in the SUNDAY FINERY . JANE peels off from her family to talk to STEPHEN . She is pleased to see him . JANE So I gather you 've never been to church ? ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 15 CONTINUED : STEPHEN Once upon a time . He smiles wryly at this Fairy Tale reference . JANE Tempted to convert ? He thinks about this . STEPHEN I have a problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise . What are you doing for lunch ? Ma makes a cracking roast . INT . DINING ROOM , HAWKING FAMILY HOME - DAY Sunday family lunch . A noisy , eccentric , bohemian atmosphere . STEPHEN 's father , FRANK opens his HOME-MADE WINE . His sister PHILIPPA ( 17 ) passes the plates . MARY ( 20 ) reads a BOOK . FRANK HAWKING And Jane ? What are you studying ? JANE Arts . Languages , poetry . I'm thinking of doing a PhD eventually . FRANK HAWKING Oh ? What in ? The HAWKINGS , impressed , nod approvingly at STEPHEN . JANE ( ENCOURAGED ) Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula . PHILIPPA snorts back laughter , whilst the other HAWKINGS stare blankly at JANE for a moment , before silently returning to setting the table . FRANK rescues the mood - FRANK HAWKING Arts . So , what painters do you like ? JANE Well , I like -- Turner ... FRANK HAWKING Really ? Turner ? To me they all look as if they 've been left out in the rain . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 16 CONTINUED : STEPHEN laughs . JANE shoots him a surprised look , as FRANK pours a glass of wine . JANE And ... William Blake . PHILLIPA Good heavens . Surely not ! FRANK HAWKING ( TO JANE ) Will you try my elderflower wine ? JANE Yes , please . STEPHEN ( TO JANE ) Do n't touch it , do n't touch it Jane . Enter ISOBEL , STEPHEN 's mother , with a ROAST CHICKEN . As FRANK passes wine , JANE looks nervously at STEPHEN , who smiles at her . FRANK picks up the CARVING KNIFE and starts to SHARPEN it . FRANK HAWKING Stephen does n't like my homemade wine . Philistine . ( TO STEPHEN ) If you do n't watch out I 'll send you back with a couple of bottles . PHILLIPA So Stephen , you 've been to church with a good woman . Are you feeling holier than thou ? STEPHEN Positively saintly , thank you . JANE ( TO STEPHEN ) You 've never said why you don't believe in God . STEPHEN A physicist ca n't allow his calculations to be muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator . STEPHEN smiles , pleased with himself , and his mother and father seem pleased with it too . JANE notices - ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 17 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) JANE Sounds less of an argument against God than against physicists . JANE 1 , STEPHEN O . She eats her food . FRANK HAWKING ( IMPRESSED ) Light or dark ? ( Re : the chicken ) Jane ? Light meat or dark ? JANE Er - light , please . STEPHEN I 'll wing it . As usual . The old family PUNNING game has begun . PHILLIPA Boooo . FRANK HAWKING How plucky of you . PHILLIPA Ohh , fowl play ! Fowl play . STEPHEN Stop egging him on ! FRANK HAWKING It 's so nicely cocked . Hawking laughter . Ha ! Ha ! JANE is bemused . ISOBEL ( sympathetic , to JANE ) Do n't worry about them . They're pun mad . FRANK is about to place a slice of CHICKEN BREAST on JANE's PLATE - JANE That 's okay - ( TENTATIVELY ) - the breast is yet to come . FRANK guffaws , as he plates her chicken . FRANK HAWKING HA ! Marvelous ! Very good . `` The breast is yet to come ! '' Indeed it is ! Well done .

COUNTRY ROADS - NIGHT To the blaring strains of WAGNER , the HAWKING car careens across the countryside . EXT . GONVILLE & CAIUS COLLEGE/MAY BALL - NIGHT On the GRAND FRONT LAWN of the COLLEGE , a fairy-tale party - LIGHTS IN THE TREES , a throng of GOWNED YOUNG WOMEN , and YOUNG MEN IN BLACK TIE and TAILS , all sip CHAMPAGNE on the sequestered CROQUET LAWNS , as if from a by-gone age . A BATHTUB is full of CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES ON ICE . Through this STEPHEN and JANE drift . INT . GONVILLE & CAIUS COLLEGE/ MAY BALL - NIGHT STEPHEN and JANE stand and watch the swirling couples on the dance-floor , sipping PUNCH . The MAY BALL is now in full and magical swing , as couples float across the lawns before the great facade of the college . JANE Should we dance , do you think ? STEPHEN Oh , no , no . Happy to observe the phenomenon -- but I ca n't possibly imagine participating . JANE I absolutely agree . I mean , who would want to dance ? ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 19 CONTINUED : STEPHEN No , I 'm quite serious . I don't dance . JANE has a wistful look of disappointment . AWKWARD SILENCE . Just then - A BLUE UV LIGHT comes on . This causes great excitement on the dance-floor . All the other couples `` ooh '' and `` ahh '' and even more people take to the floor - not so , STEPHEN and JANE . STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) ( SOFTLY ) Do you see how the men 's cuffs and shirt-fronts , how they glow more than the dresses ? JANE ( smiles , expectant ) Yes ... STEPHEN Do you know why ? JANE Why ? STEPHEN `` TIDE . '' JANE The washing powder ? STEPHEN The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light . JANE Why do you know that ? STEPHEN ( GRINS ) When stars are born and when they die , they emit UV radiation . So if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light , almost all the stars would disappear -- and all we'd see would be these spectacular births and deaths . And I reckon -- it would look a little - JANE stares at the glowing swirling people with STEPHEN's eyes . JANE - like that .

The GATSBY-THEMED BAR-STAFF are dressed in 1920's TUXEDOS and FLAPPER-DRESSES . STEPHEN So why ... ( PASSING CHAMPAGNE ) ... why ... JANE Why ? STEPHEN Why medieval Spanish poetry ? JANE surveys the gay party , sipping her champagne - JANE ( HAPPILY ) I suppose I like to time travel . STEPHEN And what particular time periods do you visit ? JANE takes the CHAMPAGNE STEPHEN has just chosen and pours half of his into her glass . JANE The Twenties is always fun . STEPHEN The roaring twenties ! Cheers ! They CLINK GLASSES and sip their champagne , laughing . STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) So -- The 1920 's . A good time for poetry was it ?

JANE Was it - They move off across the NEARBY DANCE-FLOOR , and PASS the JAZZ BAND en route to the LIGHTED FOOT-BRIDGE spanning a river under which LIGHTED PUNTS drift by . JANE ( CONT 'D ) - was it a good time for science ? STEPHEN A smashing time actually . Spacetime was born . JANE Spacetime ... STEPHEN Space and Time finally got together . People always thought they were too dissimilar , couldn't possibly work out . But then along comes Einstein , the ultimate match- maker , and decided that space and time , not only had a future , but had been married all along . JANE The perfect couple ! They arrive at the FOOT-BRIDGE , with its view of the BRIDGE OF SIGHS . PUNTS with CATHERINE WHEELS are moored nearby . D ) FOOT-BRIDGE . JANE and STEPHEN stop in the middle of the bridge .

FRONT DOOR / WILDE FAMILY HOUSE - DAY MORNING LIGHT on the WILDE FRONT DOOR . JANE , in bathrobe , opens the door to get the MILK . Looks down . PAN down to - a BOX of `` TIDE '' WASHING POWDER . She picks it up - looks around for STEPHEN - smiles , delighted - IN LOVE . EXT . PLATFORM , CAMBRIDGE TRAIN STATION - DAY SCIAMA and STEPHEN and PHYSICISTS 1,2 and 3 arrive late on the platform . The train is already pulling in . SCIAMA , and the OTHER THREE all run for it . But STEPHEN is making his way up the steps , not running - putting on a brave face . When STEPHEN arrives , just in time , the PHYSICISTS 1,2,3 , pull STEPHEN on to the train . INT . MOVING TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY As they whistle along , English countryside in the background . SCIAMA studies STEPHEN then returns his attention to his newspaper when he meets his eyes . INT . KING 'S COLLEGE CLASSROOM - LONDON - DAY ROGER PENROSE , MATHEMATICIAN , gives a passionate talk before a small audience in a small room . The blackboard is crammed with calculations and diagrams . ROGER PENROSE So what do we know ? Let me rephrase that -- what do the equations tell us , finally ? ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 23 CONTINUED : He turns the blackboard over . A blank board . ROGER PENROSE ( CONT 'D ) How about a simple diagram ? Smiles , small laughter from the audience . STEPHEN looks especially relieved . ROGER PENROSE ( CONT 'D ) A star , more than three times the size of our sun ... He draws a circle on the board . ROGER PENROSE ( CONT 'D ) ... ought to end its life , how ? With a collapse , the gravitational forces of the entire mass overcoming the electromagnetic forces of individual atoms , and so collapsing inwards . If the star is massive enough , it will continue this collapse , creating a black hole - where the warping of spacetime is so great that nothing can escape ... not even light . It gets ... He draws a smaller circle , inside the first . ROGER PENROSE ( CONT 'D ) Smaller , smaller ... An even smaller circle . ROGER PENROSE ( CONT 'D ) The star , in fact , gets denser as atoms -- even subatomic particles -- get literally crushed , smashed into smaller and smaller space . And at its end point what are we left with ? He draws a point . ROGER PENROSE ( CONT 'D ) A point . A spacetime singularity ... STEPHEN is captivated . ROGER PENROSE ( CONT 'D ) With extraordinary properties ! Infinite density . Space and time come to a stop . All of the known laws of science -- they just stop working . ( MORE ) ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 24 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) ROGER PENROSE ( CONT 'D ) What I 've just shown is that this happens in every black hole . Its really happening , out there . To real stars -- and its happening right now ! STEPHEN smiles - seeing his future revealed . INT . MOVING TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT SCIAMA and his students , returning home . As his friends talk excitedly , STEPHEN is silently staring down at the CIRCULATING COFFEE in front of him , into which he pours CREAM ... SLOWLY , CLOCKWISE - the cream is spread outward by the circulating coffee until it looks like a SPIRAL GALAXY . As he stares , deep in thought , the SPIRAL of CREAM pulses with LIGHT - he is having an epiphany here - a major insight ... ... and then TIME GOES INTO REVERSE . As it does so , the CREAM CHANGES DIRECTION , goes ANTI-CLOCKWISE now , the SPIRAL once more returning to its original central dollop , and then vanishing . The coffee creamless . STEPHEN looks up ... STEPHEN ( TO SCIAMA ) I wonder what would happen -- if -- I wonder what would happen -- Sensing his protege is on to something , perhaps even a small smile . SCIAMA Go on . If ?

So what if -- if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself ? The universe , smaller and smaller , denser and denser , hotter and hotter as we approach its birth . Wind back the clock ... JANE grabs his hands and begins to SWIRL him around . STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) What are you doing ? JANE Winding back the clock ! STEPHEN ( LAUGHING ) Is that what you 're doing ? JANE That 's what I 'm doing . STEPHEN Well keep winding !

WARD/ HOSPITAL - DAY The DOCTOR is dismissive and unsentimental . SENIOR DOCTOR It 's called motor neuron disease . STEPHEN What 's that ? The DOCTOR , despite his unsentimental nature , draws a deep breath . This is not the speech he wants to make ... SENIOR DOCTOR It 's a progressive neurological disorder that destroys the cells in the brain that control essential muscle activity such as speaking , walking -- breathing -- swallowing . The signals that muscles must receive in order to move are disrupted , cut off . The result is -- gradual muscle decay , a wasting away . Eventually , the ability to control voluntary movement is -- lost -- entirely . SHOCK sets in as STEPHEN watches other patients taking EXERCISE , stretching - walking .

For the first time - with his head resting on the step , and with his eyes turning back to look through the balusters at the REFLECTION in a DINING ROOM mirror of the dinner party ( his POV : tilted at 90 degrees ) TEARS fall out of his eyes .

Is this his future ? Is it an aid , or an enemy ? She returns to the kitchen to wash some dishes while he stares at the chair ... eventually rising , turning , poising above it , and then falling with a CRASH into it .

We see what he sees -- ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 42 CONTINUED : The LIFE OF THE UNIVERSE IN REVERSE ... STARS being pulled back together , toward a single POINT , a SINGULARITY . As the SINGULARITY takes SHAPE , a DARK CIRCLE FORMS AROUND IT , rimmed by a GLOWING CIRCULAR HORIZON . FINALLY - A BLACK HOLE has FORMED .

JANE then approaches STEPHEN , nervously . But when he looks up at her , his EYES are BLAZING WITH LIGHT and passion - this pulls her out of her SADNESS . JANE ( LOVINGLY ) Good luck ! He SMILES back at her , as the ENTRY DOORS to the HALL open , and REVEAL a PACKED EXPECTANT ROOM . It 's daunting ! SCIAMA Ready or not .

STEPHEN ( SLURRING SLIGHTLY ) ... allowing us to predict that some particles can in fact escape a black hole . Black holes aren't black at all , but glow with heat radiation . Stony , sceptical faces greet this outrageous idea . As STEPHEN continues his speech , ANGLE ON SCIAMA and TAYLOR . SCIAMA ( aside , to TAYLOR ) He 's unifying Relativity -- plus Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics . For the first time . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 44 CONTINUED : JOHN TAYLOR ( shakes head , to SCIAMA ) Thermodynamics ? Last used to describe the steam engine . During this exchange ( O.S ) STEPHEN has been saying : STEPHEN In other words -- the steady emission of heat energy causes black holes to slowly lose mass , they evaporate , eventually disappearing in a spectacular explosion . So ... INTERCUT THIS LECTURE SCENE ( as necessary ) with the FOLLOWING SCENE : INT . PUB ON RIVER , CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT BRIAN and REES , CARTER and ELLIS discuss STEPHEN 's theory . BRIAN No , no ! What he 's saying is -- just as a hot body loses heat -- right ? - REES Second law of thermodynamics .

It 's preposterous . TAYLOR drags a fellow colleague to his feet and WALKS OUT . STEPHEN Was it something I said ? SCIAMA rises to his feet , to defend STEPHEN - ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 46 CONTINUED : SCIAMA I- But then a BIG VOICE booms out - and stops TAYLOR and co in their tracks . KHALATNIKOV STOP ! Please . KHALATNIKOV makes his way to the STAGE , stopping beside STEPHEN . He addresses the audience gravely ... KHALATNIKOV ( CONT 'D ) My name -- is Professor Khalatnikov , from Soviet Academy of Sciences . My field is evolution of the hot universe -- the properties of microwave background radiation , and theory of the black holes . To be honest , I came here today expecting to hear a lot of nonsense . I go home disappointed . ( pause , points ) The little one here , has done it . ( HE SMILES ) He has done it ! Applause finally begins , small , then grows large .

BRIAN indicates 'down there ' . STEPHEN Different system . Automatic . BRIAN That 's kinda wonderful , actually . And it explains a great deal about men . BRIAN and STEPHEN then disappears over the top of the STEPS . After a few beats BRIAN reappears and runs down the steps to reclaim the wheelchair . He picks it up and starts up the steps with it . CUT TO : STEPHEN , cradled in the giant arms of a seated MARBLE STATUE ! ! ! ( maybe Queen Victoria ) - cradled like a baby , waiting for BRIAN to return . INT .

Waiting in his WHEELCHAIR on the front LAWN . About 8 YEARS have passed since we last saw him . His physical deterioration is marked . His body is thinner and powerless . His legs are bent and his face is slightly asymmetric . WIDE : Beside him is STACKED a mountain of FAMILY HOLIDAY LUGGAGE ( umbrellas , beach balls , plastic cricket set , tent etc . ) In the Background , the NEW WEST ROAD FLAT - a LARGE VICTORIAN HOUSE . The sign in front reads `` GONVILLE and CAIUS COLLEGE '' . On the LAWN the children ( ROBERT , now 9 - and LUCY , now 5 ) PLAY with BEACH TOYS , until - - JANE ( with a new haircut and fashion befitting the LATE 1970 's ) yells - JANE Get in the car ! Get ! In ! The Car ! Come on ! Let 's go see Gran and Grandad ! The CHILDREN obey , and jump into the now OLD MINI parked at the kerb , as - - JANE confronts the MOUNTAIN OF STUFF , including STEPHEN , that must somehow be stowed . No way . LATER - back and forth JANE goes between LUGGAGE and MINI . STEPHEN can only watch her load the stuff into the car and onto the ROOF-RACK . Finally - REVEAL the LOADED MINI - it looks ridiculously burdened ! JANE takes a deep , exhausted , breath , then turns back for STEPHEN . He sits there in his wheelchair , looking at her ...

But what about all the steps , Frank ? FRANK HAWKING Oh , it 's nothing . The climb is absolutely worth it . You get the luggage . FRANK backs STEPHEN ( in his wheelchair ) up the STEPS , one at a time , while ISOBEL runs up ahead with the CHILDREN , leaving JANE , alone , with ALL THE LUGGAGE .

JONATHAN Oh , is that so ? JANE ( ANNOYANCE SHOWING ) Stephen 's done a U-turn . The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all . No boundaries , no beginning . No BEGINNING - JONATHAN - no God ? Really ? ( TO STEPHEN ) Fascinating . Because I'd understood you 'd proven the need for a Creator . My mistake . STEPHEN No . Mine . JONATHAN ( UNDERSTANDING THIS ) Yours . Your mistake ? JONATHAN is surprised by this sharp reply . ( He also sees that this matter is a CAUSE OF DIVISION between JANE and STEPHEN . ) JANE Stephen is looking for a single law that governs all the forces in the universe . So God must die . JONATHAN Why must God die ? I do n't see . STEPHEN does n't react , so JANE spears a PEA on her FORK , then picks up a SECOND FORK and spears a LARGE BOILED POTATO with the other . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 59 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) JANE The two great pillars of physics ARE - ( THE PEA ) - Quantum Theory , the laws that govern the very small -- electrons , particles so on -- and General Relativity ... JONATHAN Oh , yes - Einstein . JANE ... Einstein 's theory . ( THE POTATO ) Which governs the very large , planets and such -- but Quantum - ( raises the PEA ) AND - ( raises the POTATO ) Relativity ... JONATHAN They 're -- different ? JANE They do n't remotely play by the same rules . Peas are chaotic , and do n't behave predictably at all - With her 'pea ' fork she stirs some more peas on her plate - creates 'chaos ' . JONATHAN UNLIKE -- POTATOES - JANE Which you can set your watch by . STEPHEN ( SMILING ) Very good . Even STEPHEN has begun to begrudgingly enjoy this , even as he starts COUGHING .

JANE Einstein hated peas , Quantum Theory . `` God does n't play dice with the universe '' , he said .

'' JANE God is back on the endangered species list . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 61 CONTINUED : ( 4 ) JONATHAN I expect he 'll cope . STEPHEN But physics -- is back in business . JANE Physics is back in business . Stephen thinks it a fair exchange . STEPHEN ( TO JANE ) It 's the final -- challenge . We'll know everything . JONATHAN The final challenge ?

GARDEN/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT Under a STARRY sky - JONATHAN helps STEPHEN sip his coffee . STEPHEN accepts this now . JONATHAN It was leukaemia . Coming up on a year ago . She fought it , I nursed her , but in the end ... Music is my salvation . Teaching and playing . I 've struggled with loneliness , of course . Tyranny of the empty room , all that . Music is a consolation , although my career ... Well , I 'm not very ambitious . ( SMILES ) Is that a sin ? STEPHEN Wrong guy to ask . THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 62 INT .

If I could help you , I believe I would find a purpose that would alleviate my own situation . It would be a privilege . STEPHEN looks to JANE for her reaction . JANE senses EMOTIONAL DANGER and , frightened , merely smiles . JONATHAN ( CONT 'D ) Night then . He exits . JANE shuts the door . INT . MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT JANE puts PILLOWS behind STEPHEN , who now sleeps almost upright in bed . She then takes off her BATHROBE and gets into bed herself .

Their FIRST TOUCH ! We can see that the temptation to act further on their feelings is now HUGE for both of them , but they do nothing . JANE forces herself to break away , hurries into the next room to be with STEPHEN , the kids and a train set . JONATHAN is left to deal with his feelings .

LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY STEPHEN sits in the armchair , propped up by cushions , while a TECHNICIAN bolts the NEW COMPUTER SCREEN onto STEPHEN's WHEELCHAIR . JANE watches . TECHNICIAN Almost there ! JANE How does it work ? TECHNICIAN A guy called Walt Woltosz invented the software . Uses a very simple interface that scans through the alphabet and allows each letter to be selected one by one . Using this technique , the Professor can expect to write at about four words per minute . ELAINE enters - JANE ( After initial dismay ) Better than one a minute . TECHNICIAN What I 've done is -- use components from a telephone answering system actually -- to convert the written text into synthesized speech . The voice sounds a bit robotic , but ... ( IT 'S READY ) Okay . Shall we give it a try ? CUT TO : JANE and ELAINE hoist STEPHEN into the new chair . TECHNICIAN ( CONT 'D ) There we go . ( GRANDLY ) Welcome to the future !

The COMPUTER comes to life and says STEPHEN 's first words in months . STEPHEN ( electronic voice , strong American accent ) My -- name -- is -- Stee -- ven -- Hawking . STEPHEN stares at JANE - incredulous . JANE stares back at STEPHEN - horrified . JANE It 's American ! Oh , my Goodness . ( TO TECHNICIAN ) Are there any other voices ? TECHNICIAN That 's all they have at the moment . Is that a problem ? ELAINE I think it 's great ! STEPHEN looks bewildered . INT .

STEPHEN ( O.S . ) So I said - I have long been looking for a model of the universe . I finally found her . Beside the PHOTO , ELAINE finishes SHAVING STEPHEN - then steps away to pick up some HAND LOTION . She inadvertently show him some LEG . STEPHEN notices . ELAINE laughs , and starts to massage LOTION , almost lovingly , into his HAND . JANE announce her presence . JANE Elaine ? Can we - ? ELAINE comes over to JANE , still chuckling . JANE ( CONT 'D ) Would you mind if I spoke with Stephen alone for a moment ? ELAINE We 're not quite finished -- can you come back in ten minutes ? REACTION JANE : Slightly ruffled feathers . She exits . INT . MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY JANE walks in , holding a page from the MANUSCRIPT . STEPHEN is 'typing ' a message . JANE ( READS ) `` Who are we ? Why are we here ? If we ever learn this , it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason , for then we would know the mind of God . '' ( TO HIM ) 'GOD ' ? Do you really mean this ? ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 82 CONTINUED : STEPHEN types his reply . STEPHEN Yes . ( TYPES ) Of course . JANE So you 're acknowledging him ? But as he continues to CLICK , feverishly , she excitedly exits , before he can add another word . He tries to generate the next word before she disappears but he is alone again by the time his computer belatedly spits out - STEPHEN HOWEVER -- He sags , frustrated that he was not fast enough to set her straight - but then she comes back in - JANE Did you just say something ? STEPHEN decides not to respond . JANE ( CONT 'D ) So you 're actually going to let me have this moment . STEPHEN click-click-clicks , then - STEPHEN You - are - welcome . She smiles . She kisses him on the cheek , and then as she starts to leave - - on his SCREEN - STEPHEN selects the message he was writing earlier ... clicks `` PLAY .

STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) Everything will be okay . She tries to smile . STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) How many years ? STEPHEN writes . She waits . His eyes flick between his screen and her . JANE They said - two . We 've had so many . The look in his eyes is his eloquent reply . Emotion overcomes JANE . Can this really be how it ends ? It 's so sad and bizarre and they both realise it in this moment . She tries to hide her tears by walking away from him and turning her back , hiding her face . STEPHEN watches her , as aware of the enormous significance of this moment as she - then slowly - slowly - motors toward her . He stops just behind her , then nudges her leg , ever so gently , with his own lifeless foot , the way a pony will nudge its familiar rider . He clicks `` PLAY '' - STEPHEN Be . Happy . She turns back , CROUCHES , comes down to his level - right in front of him , eye to eye - JANE I have loved you . ( BEAT ) I did my best . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 84 CONTINUED : ( 3 ) As TEARS form in his own eyes , he BLINKS ONCE at her - the only form of communication that feels right in that moment , and she understands all that it means .

The congregation departs , revealing - - JANE in her seat , still reading a prayer book , as - - JONATHAN walks up the nave , toward her , chatting with the departing CHORISTERS . It seems that he has n't noticed JANE and he passes close by , seemingly without seeing her . She averts her eyes . Then suddenly she feels a HAND brush her shoulder . When she turns to look , JONATHAN has walked past , and is still avidly talking to the CHORISTERS , heading for the main doors . JANE , with a beating heart , turns forward again and hears - - the FRONT DOORS of the church close . She is alone . She starts to cry in the empty church - thinking she has lost him forever , but then -- -- she hears SOFT PIANO MUSIC . She turns . Yes , music is coming from above . She rises , and moves toward the sound . INT . FRONT OF CHURCH - DAY ( LATE 1970 'S - MID 1980 'S ) JANE slowly walks TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE PIANO , which slowly grows louder , louder , until - - with a pounding heart , she discovers JONATHAN , at the piano , gently playing his beloved Bach . Only eventually does he raise his eyes and smile at her , a smile which expresses his hope that she would come to him . She smiles back , her heart ready to burst . _____________________________________________________________ THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 87 INT .

After a MALE FAN gets his PHOTO taken with STEPHEN - a FEMALE FAN ( at the head of a sudden queue of FANS bearing copies of `` BRIEF HISTORY '' ) holds out a PEN to STEPHEN ... FEMALE FAN Professor ? Could you please sign a copy for me ? ELAINE , gestures for STEPHEN to give his standard reply . He mouse-clicks once .

I first met -- the Professor -- was it really 1963 ? Time- -where does it go ? Back then , he was kind of annoying . ( LAUGHTER ) He knew things that his woeful work ethic should not have allowed him to know . ( LAUGHTER ) ( MORE ) ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 88 CONTINUED : SCIAMA ( CONT 'D ) But it 's been -- really -- one of the great joys of my life to watch this man defy every expectation , both scientific and personal . So it's with no small pride that I ask him to return to the stage once more , to continue to do what he has always done - answer your questions . My most irritating student , my esteemed colleague , my good friend -- Professor Hawking . As STEPHEN motors onto the stage , to applause - SCIAMA ( CONT 'D ) The first pre-selected question , please ! GUEST 1 , stands and reads her question from a SLIP OF PAPER . ( All the Questioners will do the same . ) GUEST 1 How have you been able to deal with all the physical challenges you face ? STEPHEN stares at the AUDIENCE , who wait awkwardly for a reply . It 's as if STEPHEN wishes to speak with his own voice , and is struggling to do so . In failure his eyes turn sadly to his screen , and then clicks the pad in his hand . WE HEAR : STEPHEN Can you hear me ? ( AUDIENCE LAUGHTER ) There are some things I can not do . But . They are mostly the things I do n't particularly want to do anyway . GUEST 2 Now you are recognized everywhere , how do you deal with all the attention ? STEPHEN I was stopped recently by a tourist in Cambridge who asked if I was 'the real Stephen Hawking . ' I replied that I was not , and said the real one was -- much better looking . Laughter . STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) He believed me .

As GUEST 5 rises and starts to speak , the volume goes down on this question ... GUEST 5 Professor Hawking , you have said you do n't believe in God ... CLOSE ON STEPHEN , slipping into a reverie as - he notices the CAP of a YOUNG LADY 's PEN falls off the front lecture bench and drops to the floor ... ( in SLO MO ) . STEPHEN stares at the fallen CAP . ANGLE ON : GUEST 5 , MUTED , his mouth still moving ... ANGLE ON STEPHEN gets an idea . He wants to go and pick up that fallen CAP ... Miraculously , the muscles in his slackened face start to stir ... slowly his distorted expression straightens ... his slumped head stirs and moves ... his fingers stir ... his feet ... his legs ... he slowly , slowly straightens in his wheelchair , and not only this ... he even begins to rise painfully out of it , at last standing on his own ... Standing , he crosses the floor , picks up the fallen CAP , and holds it out the pretty YOUNG LADY . She smiles at him , not at all astonished ! CUT TO : GUEST 5 - we can hear him now . ( CONTINUED ) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 90 CONTINUED : ( 3 ) GUEST 5 ( CONT 'D ) You have said you do not believe in God . Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you ? ANGLE ON : STEPHEN - back in his chair , as at the start of the scene , heart-breakingly unable to do what he wishes . STEPHEN It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies ... ANGLE ON : The CAP on the floor , just where it had fallen . ANGLE ON : STEPHEN , in his chair - then on MEMBERS of the AUDIENCE , being greatly stirred by the following words - STEPHEN ( CONT 'D ) ... but -- ever since the dawn of civilisation , people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world . There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe - and what can be more special than that there is no boundary ? And there should be no boundary to human endeavour . We are all different . There is no such thing as a standard or run of the mill human being -- but we share the same human spirit . However bad life may seem , there is always something you can do , and succeed at . While there 's life , there is hope . APPLAUSE , STANDING OVATION . ANGLE ON : ELAINE , clapping - proud .

So am I right or .. ? what if ... What if there were simple explanation about the wanders There is . But it 's so absurd , so old that no one is give it credit . / i What theory is that ? Theory Aristarchus Aristarchus argued that the earth moves . The behavior of the wandering is only an optical illusion produced by our movement in combination with his around the sun . -A heliocentric model . That 's right . / I The sun would be at the center , / i as it his deal King of the stars . / i And make as just .. be another wanderer . His work was lost in the fire that destroyed mother 's library . That 's way we have to take great care of this place . Our library / i is all that remains the wisdom of men . But every time dropping an object ... / i Who speaks ? Forgive me mistress , love . i was listening . / i Speak up , Davo . If the earth is moving , Page 17/41 every time dropping an object , should fall further behind . And the wind always blow against us . And the birds would be wipe on . I told you the hypothesis of Aristarchus that no sense at all . I feel that what you said be refuted . But right now I do not know how . Make way for the prefect ! Make way ! Make way for the prefect ! Make way ! Listen everyone ! Prepare to listen and obey the verdict of our emperor / i I , Flavius Theodosius Augustus emperor and supreme Head of the provinces of the Orion , having been informed the event notice recently in city Alexandria , / i hereby declare and command let me insurgents be forgiven and released ... In exchange for my generosity , the insurgents leave the Serapeum and the Library immediately allowing Christians to enter / i and make use of facilities whatever you like . What can we expect ? We destroy everything ! Pagans will leave .. ! The Books . And they will be escorted to their homes . Obey immediately ! Keep yourself together ! Page 18/41 Send half a regiment the other side . We will send the rest later . Yes , sir . Prefect . I want they may not contain long . On the cross ! On the cross ! Keep yourself together ! Let the minor works ! - What are the minor works ? - take only important ! The soldiers retreated ! Slave / i - Have you seen my mistress ? - Just get out here and help ! - We can not with so many ! We need for help . Please do n't get my father here . / i Slave / i Come on ! Come on , quickly ! Hypatia and her students follow in the atrium . Are they crazy ? If they want , let them burn . Come on ! Quickly ! Lady . Where were you ? Take out that sack . Lady We have to go . - Take out the sack / i My slaves never around when you need it . I was ... - Move move quickly ! Idiot ! Run !

Davo , do not . - Come on ! - Davo ! - Davo , no ! - Come ! By the cross / i Alleluia , alleluia , alleluia ! Slave / i Davo ! Davo ! Davo the slave ! Help me with this ! Help ! Alleluia , alleluia , alleluia ! Pagan scum ! The most of wound be ulcerated . I know . I know . Davo . Davo ! You are free . Go . Go . From now on , in Alexandria only permitted ceremonies Christian and Jewish . pagan sacrifices , / i the worship of pagan symbols and visits to pagan temples are prohibited . If someone makes such acts or even look at the statues / i of their ancient gods , shall be punished without mercy . / i Damn Jews ! Damn Jews ! They 're just a bunch of thugs , Page 20/41 a bunch of animals . Joran , my dear friend , calm down . Let Bishop Cyril begun his own depend . Prefect our blessed parabolans , Hung hi has just called me .. ? the bird , / i default them self .. strong enough to carry loads repel , six , levers ... And stones ! Prefect can carry stones . I know they was enter the theater and stoned knowing we 'll do nothing to defend Non sense . Because it is the Sabbath ! On the Sabbath you should honor God in your synagogues instead stopping yourself set in theater . Therefore I showered stones . Prefect , you hear that ? Now he threatened us . It is too much .. / i Friends , there are more things that unite us than divide us . We are brothers ! We are all brothers Where would you Christians be without the Jews ? Jesus was a Jew ! Jesus was Jewish ! There is .a .something I find stubbing what You 've told . - What ? Well , Why Cyril begin to cleaning up the city ? is he not satisfied with what they already have ? He just wants to scare the Jews . but why you say then before .. Page 21/41 What if really interesting .. you and not them ? Me ? Why ? I 'm as Christian as he . Yes , but forget that many of your friends that circle are not . A full sail , prefect . Lets go . -Aspasius , you ready ? Yes , mistress . I would like you to take the sack and flying to top the mast . And now , Lady , Will you finally tell me what the point ? When Aspasius drop the sack , the boat will be moving forward . Therefore , the sack not fall at the foot of the mast , but will fall further back . About ... here . And what 's so special about that ? - Yes ! - But You 're wrong ! Yes , but this is definitely proved definitive . The sack / i has behaved as if the boat stationary . What does that mean ? / i i do not know . But the same principle can be applied to the Earth . we could be moving around the sun without our knowledge . -Aristarchus . Exactly . / I Why are you troubled yourself by that , Lady ? Ptolemy not perfect , / i Page 22/41 but it works . Orestes , as this with you warrior ... A few years ago you was not so pragmatic , prefect . A few years ago i spoke first before thinking . I have Cepheus third . / i Venus and Mars share house in Aquarius . My father would have celebrated something like a good wine . The stars will not fall . - Really ? No , because they are subject to the hood . / i The lid opens two heart and Jesus will appear . / i What chance for you talking about ? Do not you know that the universe is a huge chest , do n't you ? They laid on top and the Earth ground . In this idiot not been told that the Earth is round ! The Earth is flat . Your head is really flat . Read the Scriptures ! If the earth is round , Why not the people that live in the bottom , fall out ? What about the one sides ? Why not slip ? Think about it . Davo knows . hi Brother . What do you say ? Does the earth is flat or round ? Only God knows these things . Leave them in the ground ! Where they are belong ! Lady , do not despair . Today in the boat you make great progress . Why do the wandering very Page 23/41 that rightness so unexpected ? And what is worse , Why does the sun ? Why is change size summer to winter ? Perhaps it 's because sometimes is nearer / i and sometimes farther ? But Aspasia watch . According Aristarchus , the sun must be in the center of everything . With us , the Earth , traveling in a circle around him . Therefore , and this is the key We are always exactly same ... distance . If , as you say , accept that changes the distance , that forces us to add epicycle into orbit Earth . To be closer and then farther away . / i Now then we fall in the same trap as Ptolemy . -circles upon circles . - Exactly ! / I I do not know how to solve this conflict . let me know we can do it / i if shifting the center .. well./ i And not having a center / i My heart , Aspasia . So , What do we do ? Resting , lady . Parabolans ! - Parabolans ! - What happens ? parabolans , quick ! Page 24/41 Help ! / I San Alejandro is on fire ! It is a fire . Come on ! Gather water ! The cube ! Take it ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Come , come ! Parabolans ! Parabolans ! Parabolans , quick ! Where 's the fire ? Where 's the fire ? Jews ! It 's a trap . It 's a trap ! Christians all last night is one night was deplorable . Now I say to you . Grave no longer for our dead brothers . weep not . Said you killed for the others , but they are executioners . Yes , yes . Weep for them . Then they they know neither God , neither love nor holiness . I do not know . because in this day who repeated the Scriptures without understanding at all . It is they who saw only a man when the Son of God standing on the front of us . And it is they who in their blindness mocked Him and crucified him . / i Yes Weep ! Weep for the Jews , the murderers of our Lord . Page 25/41 Because God ... God has already condemned . It is God will .. to live as slaves , / i cursed and exiled until the end of time . Damn and exiles ! Damn and exiles ! Damn and exiles ! Lady , do not stop , Lady . Now whole the Jews want revenge ! I 'm afraid you do not understand what is really happening . When this is over , would be no more Jews in Alexandria . / i Sorry to interrupt like this . Lady , you know risk to coming here . Where are the troops ? Why do not more soldiers on the streets ? No army can contain entire city . Calling to the annihilation of Women and Children / i A bishop ! - A Christian ! Then lock him up . Prefect You should have an arrested . not so easy . / i Lady , Cyril knows we both share the same faith . That place our prefect in the / i very out of position . / i If he defends the Jews , half the city will rise against this government . I see . But if you do nothing now , I believe that Cyril Page 26/41 will continue do the same thing over and over again until no people for this government to govern . How naive with me . How naive I was to think with Jews . / i Jews out ! is the first kill them and then buried them . The Bishop of Cyrene . - What is he doing here ? I 'll find out It 's my little library of Alexandria . This is where I teach children . A cone of Apollonius . Yes , I did it to teach the four corners . / i Circle , / i the ellipse ... Orestes and should be here by now . The parabole and hyperbola . It 's beautiful . Often I look and wonder why the circle co axis is such impure shapes . / i What i get to sit here again I bored you . A long time not do nothing to hit my head . And there are more important issues to deal with . Forgive me . Two Christians in the hands of a pagan . It 's outrageous ! outrageous . - How many ? I do not know , but it will stink . Ammonium . Page 27/41 Does God speak to you ? All the time . Ammonium this , Ammonius that . Ammonia , Ammonia , Ammonium ... '' / i Today he spooked to me so quickly that I had to asking slow down / i Tell me something . Did you ever think what is taken ? Why ? who 's forgiven , but now , I can not forgive . Forgive ? Who ? Jews ? Jesus forgave on the cross . Jesus was God and only he can show such leniency . How dare you to compare yourself to God ? Brother . You 're still alive . Why ? Because it was His will save us on the stones . God wants us here , doing what we do . To believe in that belief ? My Lord ... Cyril is very proud man . / i Agree to meet but will not discuss the Jews , only discuss peace . Peace ? My suggestion , as your humble adviser in this case , you accept . / i Let peace be the first . Lady , what do you think ? No .. I ... It does not seem very encouraging . Page 28/41 Why would I want to come to see Orestes -without concrete proposals ? something else / I He want come to you . Demands that you see in the Library during the service on Sunday . In the Library ? Why ? Only Christians have entered there since its looting . It is a provocation ! I 'll make a suggestion . / i If you think that your presence so essential Why not let you baptize ? Most of us , beginning by the prefect , have accepted Christ . / i Why not the rest of you ? only a matter of time and you know it ! Really ? Is it only a matter of time ? Excuse me , Honorable Member but far time away .. your God has not yet proved more judge or more compassionate than their predecessors . Lady . Is it really just a matter of time before I accept your faith ? / i Why , then , should this assembly accept the consult of someone who ability dilution absolutely nothing ? I believe in philosophy . Philosophy . Just what we need in such times . Enough ! I 've been studying Page 29/41 absolutely no life . for my own And I wonder wow . - Forget about what i said today . Is all life holds for me ? What else ? I doubt anyone can see as devoted wife and mother . I think ... I think the whole city know the history of the handkerchief . So ... My father loved that one . Even he ... / i Who have the loved ? Except you , Lebanon . If only I could ... fathom this ... a little more . And get a little closer the response , / i then ... / i enough go to grave , happy . Why ? Why that 's mean so much to you ? Right now , this every second , whole earth could be moving and no one realized it . Except you and me / i Believe me Lady , it 's best that nobody notices . Really not it important ? i Do not understand why you insist moving the ground they walk on . Dress yourself what happened on the boat . Yes i dit , But that does not mean this sailing on the earth moves . What if it does / i Page 30/41 Hypatia , look around . Death , horror destruction . If the stars move in the Circle , / i why they share perfection with us / i So we are not moving . In circle . We do not move ... circle . / i We move in circles . Since Plato , all of them : Hipparchus , Ptolemy , all have tried reconcile their observations with circular orbits . / i but What happen otherwise hidden / i Another way ? Lady , There is no purer than the circle , you yourself have taught us . I know , but suppose that the purity the circle prevented us from seeing beyond . Just like the sunshine prevents us from seeing stars . I must begin again with new eyes . I have to rethink everything . All . Reading the first letter Paul to Timothy . I therefore wish that everywhere men would lift their prayers without anger or disputes . Equally , that women desire Page 31/41 dress modestly , decency and propriety without braids in her hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes , -but with good deeds . '' - Why read this passage ? I do not know , I promise which is not agreed . Let the woman learn quiet and full submission , i ca n't allow a woman / i to teach or have authority over a man , but to be silent This is the word of God ! Amen . Amen . Jesus himself knew this when he entrusted his sacred legacy twelve men . / i Men . Nothing woman among them . And yet , know some in Alexandria / i they admire and even trust in words obey woman . The philosopher Hypatia . A woman who declare , in public , her impiety . A witch ! Dignitaries , is the time for you all reconciled yourself to Christ . / i This is the word of God . Kneel before her and accept its truth . Kneel . She not you going to kneel ? She not you going to kneel ? Kneel ! Page 32/41 Kneel !

I 'll kill you . i 'm as Christian as you / i i 'm as Christian as you are / i It 's to be possible ? the guilty being executed . / i Take me to the Prefect immediately . - He himself has ordered you stay at home until further notice . / i At the moment your presence on the street now not advisable / i For what reason ? Cyril make serious allegations against you . and them . .. What is he accused me out ? on Godlines ..... And witchcraft . I see . Are you something worried about , Lady ? / i No . Tell me what concerns you . / i Prefect , that bites . Speak . The Bishop of Cyrene want to see you . Everybody go . The wound is still not ... out . Out ! Everyone out ! without went well . Do you think I had about this ? But Had she face here if to betray you ? Page 33/41 - are you blind ? Yes , i was blind . It was my head what he 's wanted for all along is me . That snake loves me . This government ! This city ! Listen . / i There will be war . I know . I know . Then swear your allegiance to me . To the Empire . Do it . Condemn him or get out . I will do it On my knees , if necessary . nut Not only that . in day i can gather with other bishops any monks who desert against Cyril . But I must ask you question . Orestes , Do you believe in Jesus ? What ? - do you believe in Jesus ? - I was ! Are you a true Christian or did you like so many others , only competent/ i -booster in politics ? -Sinesio . Why do not you kneel ? - What choice did i have ? - Why ? / I What choice did i have ? To betray Hypatia ? condemn her ? would do ? / i I never offend God . It is he who offends God . He depending in .. he .. Christian .. Christian .. is words to Use the Scriptures ... just read what is written . / i How many women do you obey / i Page 34/41 How many ? How many give you admire and ... Only one . Only one . The Scriptures ... The Scriptures is corrected and were in their hands . Brother , do not you see ? Do not see the insult to God front of everyone ? I do not know ... I do not know what .... you tell him . / i do n't tell me orestes , you believe me what is written . Do n't tell me , do you ? ... Tell Him Tell God . Kneel ! Kneel ! many other was remember today the miracles of our love brother in life . / i Like the time he commanded himself to Father and threw himself in to the fire and wasn't scorched . / i Ammonia , Death defending your faith in Christ , I proclaimed you one mother , a saint . From now on you shall be known as / i Saint Taumasius . we want justice ! / i Justice ! May God show us the way , my dear / i parabolani . Little more can I say to you .

Why did can not we do more easy and effective ? What do you talking about ? We can hurts ........ How ? That a whore . - Who ? What if we dared to look at the world just as it is / i let 's shake for a moment every preconceived ideas . / i What shape would it show us ? what shape You said once the problem is the inconsistency of the sun . Yes I did , good .. good Put it into words . The sun must be at the center as we turned around . And at the same time in another position seen the distance from it varies . Yes , exactly . - How ? How could occupy two position ? How can occupy two position at once ? How can occupy two position ? Aspasius ... Yes , yes . There . And the other one here . Maintaining the same proportion . Okay . Tie this end there . Aspasia imagines that this is Earth and the each of flames represent the two extreme positions of the sun relation to it : / i in winter and summer . Page 36/41 What happen if both positions were the two centers / i of the same circle / i That is impossible , mistress . wait what we know about the circle ? We know that center of the circles is always same distance to any point its perimeter . / i Exactly . Yes . / I What if the center divided into two but keep constant the sum distances to its perimeter / i Okay , I 'll show you what . As I move this rod along the rope , a segment increases and the other decreases . And vice versa . Thus the sum of the two always .. constant . You see that ? We apply this , to the movement Earth ? What ... will be ... obtained ? An ellipse ! An ellipse with the sun in one focus . / i Because , what is the circle but / i special ellipse whose foci are so close to get that seem one / i complete and ready , Aspasia . i mean That is , what is this ? Maybe i just .. .. Perhaps you ... What do you think ? This could be solved , mistress . Well done , we will with this tomorrow . Get some sleep . Good night , mistress . Page 37/41 Good night .

Orestes was outlawed forever and Cirilo ... ... took control of the power in Alexandria . Later , Cirilo was declared a Saint and Doctor of the Church . Although not any of Hipatia works remains , it is known that she was an exceptional astronomer , well-known for the mathematical study of conical curves .

1941;"FADE IN : 1 CLOSE SHOT - MAN 'S FACE 1 It is a large , sincere and kindly face , of about fifty-five years of age , perfectly in keeping with the slow , resonant tones in which its owner speaks . MAN ( as we fade in ) ... with purity in our hearts , with right thinking in our minds , we arm ourselves with an intolerance of all evil ! Thus , it is on this glorious Sabbath morning , in this momentous year , 1887 , that we naturally turn our thoughts to that way of life as exemplified by Victoria , Our Beloved Queen . For this week begins Her Majesty 's Golden Jubilee . Her strength and goodness , her Christian principles , have walked in the light of God ever since her ascension to the throne . From her heart has come an ever-increasing flow of virtue and moral blessing with which she has endowed us , her loving subjects . As the man speaks we BOOM BACK AND AROUND SLOWLY to discover ourselves in All Souls Southwick Church , London . The man speaking is the Bishop , talking from the pulpit , backed up by the well-appointed magnificence of the Anglican altar . WE PAN AROUND the congregation in the pews . For the most , they are the well-dressed and well-bred families of the period , listening attentively . 1A CLOSE SHOT - IN BACK - MAN AND WOMAN This is where the less well-to-do parishioners are seated . A rugged , but strange-looking man of middle-age is seated here with his wife . She is watching him anxiously . He is listening intently to the sermon , his head cocked forward . Then he looks away , passes his hand over his brow , and seems as though to rise - as he looks at the Bishop o.s . WIFE ( detaining him , with a nervous agonized whisper ) Sam - no ! What 's wrong , Sam - ? He looks at her , subsides , clenching his jaw . 1A 2 . 2 CLOSE SHOT - BISHOP 2 AS HE CONTINUES : BISHOP ( continuing ) She came upon a world sadly mired in ways of the flesh , and during her reign the forces of good have achieved notable and great victories over the forces of evil . And though we know not the time nor the season , we know that Evil in God 's own time shall be wiped out by God . At this point the Bishop is startled by the interruption of a high-pitched , scornful evil laugh coming from the back of the church . He looks up . 3 CLOSE SHOT - IN BACK - MAN AND WOMAN 3 The man is laughing evilly at the Bishop . His horrified little wife is trying to quiet him , and then looking about her at the other startled people . WOMAN ( agonized ) Sam -- Sam -MAN ( sneering out ) Evil wiped out , eh ? So you want to take all the fun out of life , eh , Bishop ? 3A CLOSE SHOT - BISHOP 3A With hardly a flicker he continues : BISHOP And may we not live for the day , when , in the words of Holy writ , the Devil shall be cast into the bottomless pit ? 4 GROUP SHOT - CONGREGATION The laughter from o.s . continues a little . One or two half turn about . Several look at each other , then back to the Bishop with stiff-backed composure . BISHOP 'S VOICE For surely the roots of the realm and its peoples have sprung from a new goodness during these last decades -- 4 3 . 5 CLOSE SHOT - TOWARD ALTAR - GROUP 5 They are the backs of an elderly gentleman , a young girl and fine-looking man of about thirty with a Byronic head . As the laughter continues through the Bishop 's persistent intonation , the man turns full face into CAMERA AND looks back toward the disturbance . He is Dr. Henry Jekyll , his vital features alive with interest . BISHOP 'S VOICE ( continuing ) At the family hearth , in the shops of industry , in the very Christian graciousness with which men and women greet each other during the everyday -6 OUT . 6 7 CLOSE SHOT - MAN IN BACK 7 MAN Bottomless Pit , my eye ! Good old Beelzebub - the boy with the horns and the spiked tail - they 're always running him down and he 's the winner in the end every time . A man in back of him tries to pull him down , quietly . He shakes him off laughing . In the b.g . the aislemen are hurrying down to him . 8 GROUP SHOT - CONGREGATION 8 Still they do not look about much , paying even more attention to the Bishop . BISHOP 'S VOICE ... everyday hours . Certainly this universal goodness is evidenced all about us more and more as we -9 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 9 As he looks back , studying man . The young girl with him starts to look back but the old gentleman on her other side nudges her not to do so . 10 CLOSE SHOT - BISHOP 10 With barely a flutter of an eyelid he continues , cutting it short . ( CONTINUED ) 4 . 10 CONTINUED : 10 BISHOP -- as we live under the gentle hand of Her Majesty , and worship the glory and wonder that is God . It is because of these things that - that ( he gives a signal to the choir-master ) - the world moves forward today . 11 CLOSE SHOT - CHOIR MASTER 11 He signals over to the organist in the b.g . He motions to the awed kids in the choir to stop looking toward the back of the church . The music starts the introduction to the choral anthem . 12 GROUP SHOT - IN BACK - AROUND MAN 12 The aislemen are struggling with him . MAN ( with a last shout ) You do n't think evil is on a holiday in here , do you ? Ask this bunch here when they met up with Old Nick last ! Good Old Beelzebub ! -- Blasphemy , I call it , to talk that way about a man 's best friend ! But he is drowned out both by the sudden high soprano boys' choir and the booming of the organ , as well as the fact that the three aisle - men drag him out of the pew into the vestry . The poor wife follows . But the other people hardly notice him , in their disciplined conservatism . One aisleman dashes on ahead . 13 GROUP SHOT - VESTRY 13 A knot of aislemen are around the raving , twisting man . He is laughing and muttering evilly . The little wife is hovering about , wringing her hands , as they lead the man from the main part of the church . AD LIB ( in hushed tones ) Here , here , now man - Never heard of such a thing ... ssh ! Did Parker go for a constable ? Yes . Take his other arm ... This is frightful ... WOMAN ( agonized ) Sam dear - no , lad - no ... ( CONTINUED ) 5 . 13 CONTINUED : 13 Just at this moment Jekyll comes hurrying out into the vestry . JEKYLL ( with calm authority ) One moment , please . The aislemen step back . MAN ( to Jekyll , who studies him ) Let me back in there and I 'll tell 'em what a grown man really thinks about Jekyll feels the man 's pulse , lifts his eye-lid . The man backs away a little . JEKYLL ( to woman ) How long has this been going on ? WOMAN It 's - it 's been coming on him worse , sir - ever since the explosion . JEKYLL ( very interested now ) Oh , a shock , eh ? ... Excellent - I see -MAN ( slyly - to Jekyll ) You 're a hearty , full-blooded young man - you tell 'em ... WOMAN I thought maybe if we came to church it would -MAN ( trying to nudge Jekyll ) We know - do n't we ? WOMAN ( as man laughs again ) No , Sam - there now The man edges her away from him . In the meantime , Jekyll has taken a card out and is writing on it . At this moment , another aisleman comes in with a very officious constable . ( CONTINUED ) 6 . 13 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) 13 CONSTABLE Hey - make way here ! What 's all this about ? What 's all this here ( taking man who he sees is struggling ) Drunk and disorderly , eh ? Well -JEKYLL ( handing constable the card ) No , Constable . Take him to the Camden Hospital . Give this card to Dr. Heath . CONSTABLE Better get him to the station , sir . It 's always ( then seen name on card , and looks up at Jekyll with sudden respect ) Oh , Dr. Jekyll ! Bats , is he ? Right , sir . Camden Hospital it is , Dr. Jekyll ! ( takes man 's arm , cheerily ) All right there now , my beauty upsy-daisy ! We 'll go and get a little fresh air in the belfry , eh ? WE PAN HIM out with the man , the woman following . MAN ( as he is being led out , calling back over his shoulder ) Jekyll , eh ? Go on back and try to put old Beelzebub on his pit bottom , Jekyll ! He 'll show you ! He 'll poke his red beard over the rim ! He jumps on hot fiery rubber , he does ! 14 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 14 As he looks after the man , considering him , turns and goes back into church . MAN 'S VOICE ( o.s. , with awful laugh ) Dr. Jekyll , eh ? ... ha , ha , ha - Go back and be good , Dr. Jekyll ... ( CONTINUED ) 7 . 14 CONTINUED : 14 The voice diminishes , as Jekyll turns and walks back into church . 15 PAN SHOT JEKYLL 15 WE HOLD as he comes down the aisle to his pew . Just as he reaches the pew the congregation rises and starts singing the hymn to which the choir has been singing the introduction . WE PAN HIM into his pew where he immediately starts singing with his two companions . The girl is young , lovely , ripely virginal , Beatrix Emery . She gives Jekyll a little questioning look as he comes into pew . The elderly man is her father , Sir Charles Emery - hawk nose over white mustache - correct and cultured in his imperious strength . As they sing , we DISSOLVE TO : 15A FULL SHOT - EXT . - CHURCH STEPS 15A Service is over and the crowd is coming out . Inside the church we hear the organ . Sir Charles , Beatrix and Jekyll are coming out . WE PAN THEM DOWN THE STEPS across to the carriages at the curb . SIR CHARLES ( bowing to a lady and gentlemen ) Harrison ... good morning ! ( turns to Beatrix and Jekyll ) Well , we 've just time for a turn in the park BEATRIX Harry has to leave us , Father . JEKYLL I must get to the hospital , sir . SIR CHARLES Hospital ? On a Sunday ? Oh , you mean that outrageous individual that - ? BEATRIX Harry says Providence dropped the poor man right into his lap . SIR CHARLES But this is most unusual , my boy . You know , we always take our stroll before -JEKYLL I 'm sorry , but it is , sir . Most unusual . ( CONTINUED ) 8 . 15A CONTINUED : 15A By this time they have reached Sir Charles [ ... ] smart open carriage . A footman stands holding the door open for them . A groom , in similar livery , is on the box . BEATRIX ( turning to him ) See you at the Marley 's tonight , now . Do n't be late . JEKYLL And let you have free rein with all those men ? He kisses her on the lips , much to Sir Charles ' consternation . She laughs and gets into carriage . Sir Charles , nervous about the kiss , looking about to see who has noticed it , follows Beatrix into carriage . 15B CLOSE TWO SHOT - BEATRIX AND JEKYLL 15B She sits with her hand resting on the side of the carriage . O.s . the footman closes the door . JEKYLL ( intimately ) That 's a very silly little hat , by the way . BEATRIX I knew you 'd like it . JEKYLL ( picking up her hand kissing it ) There 's really nothing about you that I like at all . As he holds her hand , he makes a surreptious little bite at it . 15C CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 15C He has been watching ; he starts nervously as he sees Jekyll do this . SIR CHARLES ( to groom , o.s . ) All right , Jenkins . 15D GROUP SHOT - AROUND CARRIAGE 15D The carriage drives o.s . Jekyll starts backing away , in the opposite direction , waving to Beatrix . He backs into a fat old dowager . ( CONTINUED ) 9 . 15D CONTINUED : 15D JEKYLL ( to glaring dowager ) I beg your pardon ! 15E CLOSE SHOT - BEATRIX AND SIR CHARLES - INT . CARRIAGE PROCESS 15E Beatrix is waving and laughs louder as she sees Jekyll's dilemna o.s . As she laughs louder , Sir Charles pulls her around . SIR CHARLES My dear - please BEATRIX But you did n't see him . He backed right into Lady -SIR CHARLES My dear Beatrix - I 'm a very broadminded man , as you know - but despite the fact that you and Harry are engaged to be married , I wish he would n't carry on his demonstrations of affection in public . BEATRIX Now , Father darling - do n't be pompous . SIR CHARLES ( bowing to a passerby o.s . ) But good heavens - nibbling your knuckles ... Beatrix bursts out in a peal of healthy laughter , throwing back her head . SIR CHARLES ( quickly ) Beatrix - ! 16-25 OUT . 15F CLOSE SHOT - BEATRIX - PROCESS 15F She controls herself , and subsides to a giggle , shaking her head at her Father 's attitude , as we DISSOLVE TO : 10 . 16 CLOSE SHOT - INT . HOSPITAL - MRS. HIGGINS ' FACE 16 Mrs. Higgins is the woman with the man who caused the disturbance in the church . She is sobbing silently in contrast to Beatrix and WE PULL BACK to see her standing outside a door in the corridor of the hospital . AS WE HOLD the door opens and a young interne steps out with a rather surreptitious look back into the room . All we can see in the room is the end of a bed with a man 's feet strapped to it . MAN 'S VOICE ( Higgins , as door opens ) Now , Doctor , my lad - as man to man we know what 's fun in life and what is n't ! Eh , Doctor ? The man laughs wildly . The interne closes the door quietly and WE PAN HIM as he hurries down the hall to the end , and enters a door . 17 CLOSE SHOT - DOOR AT END 17 On it is marked : `` House Physician - Dr . Heath . '' INTERNE 'S VOICE I 'm sorry , sir . But Dr. Jekyll insists going ahead with treatment . HEATH 'S VOICE But that must n't be ! The man 's under observation ! INTERNE 'S VOICE Yes , sir . That 's what I told him , but -- You better come , sir . The young interne comes out with Dr. Heath , a matured physician of about fifty . Dr. Heath wears a worried frown on his face . WE TRUCK WITH THEM a little way back toward the room . DR. HEATH ( agitated - as they come out ) He has no right to do such a thing ! INTERNE I suggested it would be better that he consult you first , sir - but he still -DR. HEATH I know . Thank you , Fenwick . ( CONTINUED ) 11 . 17 CONTINUED : 17 WE PAN them on down the hall to the door where Mrs. Higgins is waiting . 18 CLOSE SHOT - AT PATIENT 'S DOOR Dr. Heath enters the room . Mrs. Higgins sobbing , puts her hand on the interne 's arm as he is about to follow . Inside , the man Higgins is laughing evilly . MRS. HIGGINS Is n't there anything they can - ? INTERNE Everything possible is being done , Mrs. Higgins . Dr. Jekyll knows more about your husband 's case than any other mental specialist in London . HIGGINS ' VOICE ( from inside ) Why ! Here 's another doctor ! But don't ask him ! He 's too old ! The interne closes the door . The man 's high laugh comes from inside . Almost immediately the door is opened by Dr. Heath who comes out with Jekyll . DR. HEATH It 's a matter of ethics , Jekyll . I ca n't allow it . MRS. HIGGINS Dr. Jekyll , ca n't I go in and -JEKYLL ( gently , patting her shoulder ) Not yet , Mrs. Higgins . Bear up now . That 's the way you said you 'd help remember . Continues to Heath as WE PAN THEM DOWN the corridor , Jekyll obviously trying to control himself JEKYLL But , good heavens , man - this is the chance of a lifetime for me . The more I see of the case the more I realize it . The stop a little way down the hall , opposite an open unoccupied room . 18 12 . 19 TWO SHOT - HEATH AND JEKYLL 19 HEATH It 's quite possible that this case might fall within the bounds of your research . You know how we 've all admired your other work in the past . And personally , I 'd like to bow to your opinion here , but in my position as head of the staff , I can not countenance -He stops and realizes they are being watched o.s . as he looks down the hall . 20 CLOSE SHOT - MRS. HIGGINS - THEIR ANGLE 20 She stands looking at them pathetically , wringing her hand . 21 TWO SHOT - JEKYLL AND HEATH 21 HEATH ( indicating open door ) Better come in here . They go into vacant room and close door . 22 SLOW TRUCKING SHOT - MRS. HIGGINS 22 She looks at the room her husband is in , then starts timorously along the hall to the door behind which are Heath and Jekyll . WE HOLD A SECOND here . She would like to go in . She starts to knock . Jekyll 's and Heath 's voices are only murmurs . JEKYLL 'S VOICE ( suddenly rising clear ) But I 'm not witch doctor ! HEATH 'S VOICE ( rising , too - very clear ) Who 's called you a witch doctor ? You told me yourself you 've had no definite success . I ca n't allow you to experiment with There are sudden quick footsteps toward door , and it is flung open by Jekyll . HEATH ( following him ) Why , the man 's a human being - ! Jekyll wheels on him at the door , his eyes blazing . ( CONTINUED ) 13 . 22 CONTINUED : 22 JEKYLL You mean he was a human being ! And he 'd have another chance at it , if you 'd keep your hide-bound ethics out of this ! There are n't any rules for discovering medical Utopia ! Or perhaps you have n't the courage to face what might be the greatest - ! He stops , glaring impotently at Heath , who steps back a little , so vehement is Jekyll 's look and attitude . Then , with an inarticulate growl of disgust , Jekyll wheels away quickly , AS WE TRUCK AND PAN with him to the end of the corridor and around the corner . The tension of his anger relaxes into a bitter smile as he walks along . He passes some swinging glass opaque doors marked : `` CHILDREN 'S WARD '' , and is about to go on when he thinks of something and turns back , entering the ward . 23 PAN SHOT - JEKYLL - INT . WARD 23 As he walks down between corridor of beds and steps quickly behind screen which covers the fourth of fifth bed . This is obviously the Children 's Orthepedoic Ward as we see by the condition of the patients in the various beds . 24 CLOSE SHOT - AT BED 24 A small boy has obviously been badly smashed in an accident . A worried young father , sitting by the bed , gets up quickly as Jekyll comes in . The little boy , his legs suspended in a pully contraption , smiles weakly at Jekyll as the latter feels his pulse . JEKYLL ( to little boy ) Hullo , Tommy Atkins - how 's the war ? The little boy laughs in weak happiness . FATHER ( to Jekyll ) He 's - he 's going to be all right , is n't he , doctor ? Jekyll waits a second , counting pulse . JEKYLL ( smiling at boy ) Charlie and I never had a doubt about it , did we , Charlie ? At this moment o.s . we hear a little girl 's voice wailing . ( CONTINUED ) 14 . 24 CONTINUED : 24 LITTLE GIRL 'S VOICE ( O.S . ) I ca n't ! Please , nurse -NURSE 'S VOICE ( O.S . ) Now do as nurse says , Dorothy . Jekyll looks in the direction of the voice and walks off o.s . 25 35 GROUP SHOT - AISLE BETWEEN BEDS 25 A nurse is trying to get a little girl of five or six to throw away her crutches and walk . The little girl is frightened . Neither of them notices Jekyll as he comes out in the aisle and watches the scene . NURSE Give the crutches to nurse now , Dorothy . DOROTHY ( her lip quivering ) I ca n't ! I 'll fall again . I don't want to fall again . NURSE ( starting to reason again ) Dorothy dear , listen to me . If I tell you - ? 26 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 26 Jekyll is studying Dorothy o.s . DOROTHY 'S VOICE But I 'll hurt myself some more . I ca n't walk . JEKYLL ( suddenly - firmly ) Dorothy ! ( he exits towards her ) 27 CLOSE SHOT - DOROTHY AND JEKYLL as she looks at Jekyll , who comes into SCENE . DOROTHY ( slowly ) What , sir ? JEKYLL Give me those crutches . 27 15 . 28 FULL SHOT 28 Dorothy allows Jekyll to take the crutches from her . She stands wavering . JEKYLL ( without holding out hands ) Now walk . Walk here to me . Dorothy teeters after him as he backs up slowly for fifteen feet . As she reaches Jekyll he kneels down and steadies her . 29 GROUP SHOT - JEKYLL , DOROTHY AND NURSE 29 DOROTHY ( looking at him in wonder ) I walked ! I walked , did n't I ? JEKYLL ( almost severely ) Dorothy , always remember you can do anything in this world you put your mind to . ( then patting her head with a grin ) Why , you 'll be dancing on Hampstead Heath next Bank Holiday ! He straightens up and hands her over to the nurse who exits with her . Jekyll turns and WE PAN HIM OUT of the ward . 30 FULL SHOT - EXT . WARD 30 Just as Jekyll comes out into corridor ; he is joined by a pleasant , solid-looking man of about his age , Dr. John Lanyon , his friend and colleague . Lanyon , a stethescope about his neck , yet attired as Jekyll , looks concerned as WE TRUCK THEM down the corridor . DR. LANYON Harry , old boy , what 's up ? There're rumors of a tiff between you and -JEKYLL ( with a calming gesture , and a rueful smile ) Do n't worry , John . The bull is leaving the china shop . DR. LANYON But you must realize that Heath has his - ( CONTINUED ) 16 . 30 CONTINUED : 30 JEKYLL ( sardonically , yet with affection ) I realize , Dr. John Lanyon , my friend and eminently respected surgeon that your Dr. Heath is right . My treatment was not yet thoroughly proven . And if we doctors were allowed to experiment on human beings , too many things would go wrong - and human beings might lose faith even in the proven good of medicine . Is n't that it ? By this time WE HOLD as they reach a table near the foyer on which doctors have placed their hats and sticks and from which Jekyll picks up his . DR. LANYON ( attempting to reason ) Harry -JEKYLL ( now definitely ) But I 'm not far from proof ! And when I get it : Ethics or no ethics ! Lanyon shrugs , and laughs , patting Jekyll with a soothing gesture on the back , and exiting o.s . down another turn of the corridor . Then Jekyll thinks of something and starts quickly back down the corridor just as the interne of the previous SCENE rounds a corner to meet him , carrying a leather vial case . WE HOLD . INTERNE ( handing case to him ) I thought perhaps you 'd -JEKYLL ( quickly , serious ) Yes . ( opens case , runs his fingers over tops of vials disclosed to see if all are there , then closes it ) Thank you , Fenwick . We PAN HIM as he turns back toward foyer again , taking out a key and locking case as he goes , as we , DISSOLVE TO : 41-42 OUT . 17 . 31 FULL SHOT - EXT . JEKYLL 'S HOUSE - LATER 31 It is the type of house found in Harley Street of Adam architecture , proving Jekyll 's means and position . Jekyll's carriage draws up and stops . 31A CLOSER SHOT - AT CARRIAGE 31A Jekyll merely sits and stares ahead of him , unaware that he is home . The groom , not hearing him open the door , looks around . This causes Jekyll to look at the groom , realize they have reached home . JEKYLL Oh - yes , Burke He gets out , and WE PAN HIM up to the front door . He takes out his key and enters . 32 OUT . 32 33 FULL SHOT - INT . ENTRANCE HALL - JEKYLL 'S HOUSE 33 Jekyll lets himself in with the key , walks slowly to the center of the hall , stands there in thought for a second . Poole , his butler , an old man full of warm adoration for him , is hurrying down the stairs , and goes to him . POOLE ( taking his hat and stick ) Good afternoon , sir . JEKYLL ( almost to himself ) Hello , Poole ... POOLE I 'm so glad you 're home for tea , sir . Where will you take it ? JEKYLL ( strolling slowly away ) Oh - anywhere .... ( CONTINUED ) 18 . 33 CONTINUED : 33 POOLE ( hurrying up beside him ) I 'll be bound you 've had no lunch ... those hospitals . Some nice buttered crumpets , sir - but we must n't have too much , or we sha n't be eating a good dinner at the Marley 's - and Miss Beatrix would be after me properly . JEKYLL ( not having heard a word ) Hmmm ... With this he quickens his pace , and darts through an entrance way off the hall . 34 FULL PAN SHOT - EXT . COURTYARD AND BRIDGE - JEKYLL 'S HOUSE 34 The back court and garden are sunk below the ground level of the main house . Jekyll comes from the main house across a bridge which leads to another separate building in back , his laboratory . He reaches door of lab . Poole stands in the door of the main house . POOLE Shall I serve it in the laboratory , sir ? 35 CLOSE SHOT - POOLE - AT DOOR OF MAIN HOUSE POOLE ( calling after him losing patience ) Now you must have something , you know - ! He stops as WE HEAR a door slam o.s . He shakes his head hopelessly . 35 19 . 36 FULL SHOT - INT . LAB 36 In the center of the room is a huge work-table covered by a strange series of test tubes , vials , crucibles , a smelter ... and a mysterious pharaphernailia of connected glass stills form a weird unknown world in themselves . There is a cabinet full of surgical instruments and another larger closed cabinet with a heavy lock . There is little furniture except a writing desk with a file and a chair . Jekyll hurries along a balcony and down a flight of steps at the back into the room . He places his case on the table . WE DOLLY AND PAN HIM over to a row of cages filled with rats , guinea pigs and rabbits . His manner is anxious , anticipatory . He looks at the first two or three cages . In the first a couple of guinea pigs seem rather active . He looks at their actions closely . He seems a little excited as he passes to the next two cages , but then his expression falls . 36A CLOSE SHOT - TWO CAGES - HIS ANGLE - 36A In one a large rabbit lies dead . In the second is a large dead rat . 36B CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 36B He reaches o.s . and picks out the two dead animals . WE PAN HIM down the wall a little . -- [ 19 ] -He takes a large rabbit out of a smaller cage . It is gentle and sniffs his hand . He strokes its head . WE PAN HIM back as he puts the rabbit into the experimental cage and then PAN HIM as he picks up a heavy glove and puts it on his hand . He stops by a cage in which is a large wharf rat , and reaches in for it with his gloved hand . 36C CLOSE SHOT - RAT - INT . CAGE He backs into a corner as Jekyll 's hand enters and then springs at Jekyll 's fingers , biting the leather . But Jekyll's hand pins him down by the back of the neck . 36C 20 . 36D CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 36D He brings the rat out and WE PAN him as he places it in the second experimental cage . He picks up the two dead animals , crosses with them to the main laboratory table . He unlocks his case and takes out a single vial and looks from vial to the dead animals . We feel a connection between them and the attempted treatment of Higgins . Jekyll frowns , then immediately starts to work . He takes out an oral syringe , tests it , looking back at the fresh animals , then he lights a gas flame under a tube , starts arranging a cooling coil , etc. , mixing concoctions , and WE DOLLY INTO HIS troubled face , as we DISSOLVE TO : 37 CLOSE SHOT - BEATRIX - INT . MARLEY DINING ROOM 37 Her expression is also troubled . She sits dawdling with her dessert , and then she looks o.s . as WE PULL BACK ALONG the table . The Marley dining room is typical of the period , high stiff chairs , seating fourteen people . They are in evening dress . Mr. Marley , the vacant-looking host , sits at one end . On his left , in order , are : Mrs. French , [ ... ] Courtney - a bearded conservative of the profession , Mrs. Courtney , Sir Charles , Mrs. Weymouth - a female eagle withered from the tropics , Colonel Weymouth , her husband , an old red-faced officer of horse in mufti with decorations on his lapel , and then Mrs. Marley , hostess . On Mrs. Marley 's right , in order are : The Bishop of All Souls , Lady Cooper - a coy female , then an empty chair , then Beatrix , Lanyon , and Mrs. Arnold next to Mr. Marley . There is quiet , well-bred small talk . A butler and two maids are in attendance .

JEKYLL 'S VOICE ( O.S . ) Mrs. Marley - ! 39 FULL SHOT - DINING ROOM 39 Jekyll is just entering the dining room from the drawing room , followed by a footman who has evidently just admitted him . Jekyll heads straight for Mrs. Marley . The men rise . 40 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL AND MRS. MARLEY 40 She looks at him a little stiffly as she offers her hand . JEKYLL My deepest apologies . MRS. MARLEY ( slightly sarcastic ) I know - you doctors - we can never rely on you , can we ? JEKYLL ( turning on charm , over her hand ) Mrs. Marley , I 'd rather be reminded of my short-comings by the smartest hostess in London than to be on the Jubilee Honors list . MRS. MARLEY ( with a double-take , completely mollified ) Ch ! Sit there , Dr. Jekyll ... She indicates vacant seat o.s. , and we PAN Jekyll as he walks to it .

JEKYLL ( to Lady Cooper - yet feeling for Beatrix's hand ) Lady Cooper - my short-comings are rewarded . LADY COOPER ( a coy dame ) Naughty man . There is correct laughter at this `` risque '' dialogue . DR. LANYON A doctor 's life , eh , Harry ? The more patients , the colder the soup . JEKYLL Was n't a patient , exactly . I started something in the laboratory and just forgot to lock at the clock . DR. COURTNEY ( a little patronizing ) Ah , yes , Jekyll - Heath was telling me you 're still carrying on with that research of yours . JEKYLL ( with a wry smile ) I 'm afraid Dr. Heath is n't quite well , in sympathy , Dr. Courtney . DR. COURTNEY Well , that 's understandable , isn't it ? ( MORE ) ( CONTINUED ) 23 . 42 CONTINUED : 42 DR. COURTNEY ( CONT 'D ) Separating the facets of the brain ... a little ambitious , I 'd say . JEKYLL ( stung ) My research hopes to go deeper than the brain -- into something more intangible than the mind , even . DR. COURTNEY ( looking at others with a laugh ) Well , all that seems to be left is the soul . Colonel Weymouth and Marley laugh . JEKYLL All right . Have it that way . Because that 's just where I am aiming -- at the soul . A maid , putting his soup in front of him , looks extremely startled . 43 CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES AND OTHERS 43 He locks amazed at Jekyll o.s. , puzzled and frowning . DR. COURTNEY 'S VOICE ( O.S . ) The soul ? AD LIB ( O.S . ) Good heavens ... did he say `` soul '' ? What does he mean ... ?

SIR CHARLES My dear Harry - of course , you don't mean this ? 46 GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL 46 He looks quickly over at Sir Charles , picking up the challenge . JEKYLL But I do , Sir Charles . Just consider that poor chap in church this morning . If you did n't see him , you all heard him , I 'm sure . BISHOP Ah , yes . I thank you for your assistance there , Dr. Jekyll . DR. COURTNEY ( with finality ) Hopelessly insane . Obviously . MRS. MARLEY Why , the simply shocking things he said ... JEKYLL He was n't insane . There was just one side of him in existence . And that side was speaking the truth . COLONEL WEYMOUTH Good heavens ! Which side ? JEKYLL His evil side . The man has been spiritually distorted through shock ... that explosion in the gas mains last month . Before that he was a fine , solid citizen - gentle and kind with his children - deeply in love with his wife . Since then , he 's suffered a complete change - so that this afternoon I saw him entirely reverted to the animal - slythinking and vile , dangerous and rapacious , by turns . ( CONTINUED ) 25 . 46 CONTINUED : 46 LADY COOPER ( in the silence , edging a little from Jekyll ) Mercy - ! 47 CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 47 The other maid is just taking away his dessert , plate . The maid looks wide-eyed at Jekyll o.s . Sir Charles is very uncomfortable . SIR CHARLES ( shifting uneasily ) Yes ... ahumm ... 48 GROUP SHOT - AGAIN 48 DR. LANYON ( trying to pass it off casually ) But Harry - what 's that to do with the soul ? We can clearly understand it as an injury to the nervous system and therefore -JEKYLL ( now lost in his subject , earnestly reasoning ) No , no , John - I insist he has been shocked from normal good into complete evil . When I said before he was a '' good '' man , I did n't mean that he did n't have a bad thought or two from time to time -- and perhaps commit his portion of transgressions against the laws of civilized society . Because , after all - that is the problem of civilized Man 's soul -the good and the evil in it are constantly fighting one another . 49 GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL AND BISHOP The Bishop is the least affronted , very interested , but adamnantly patient . BISHOP There is a Higher Source from which the good may always find aid in its fight , Dr. Jekyll .... JEKYLL I realize that , sir - but ... 49 26 . 50 CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL AND HIS WIFE 50 MRS. WEYMOUTH ( haughtily - her hand possessively on Colonel 's arm ) Of course . The Colonel and I always feel that people can be good if they wish to be - and , well - otherwise , if they do n't . COLONEL ( with a snort ) Exactly . Discipline ! Everything else is poppycock ! ( then militantly changing subject with a joke ) Haw ! But men going dotty and all that do amusin ' things at times . I remember our sergeant during the second Punjab campaign . We attacked and -MRS. WEYMOUTH It was our quartermaster . COLONEL ( not breaking his stride ) Quiet , my dear - you were in Poona at the time . I remember this 51 CLOSE SHOT - MARLEY 51 MARLEY ( his mouth agape as he still looks at Jekyll vacuously ) But look here , Jekyll - I mean I - I simply must get this straight - you mean - ? 52 FLASH SHOT - MRS. MARLEY She is trying to get her stupid husband 's eye to keep him from pressing the subject . 52 27 . 53 GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL 53 JEKYLL ( warmed to his subject , glad of the interest ) Well , to put it as simply as I can Good and evil are so close as to be chained together in the soul . Man is n't truly one , but two . Now what if we could break that chain separate those two selves - ( his face alight , lost in his subject ) To free the good in man , and let it go on to its higher destiny ... to segregate the bad in man - and let it destroy itself in its own degradation ! ( looks around , sees he has gone beyond their comprehension finishes lamely ) Well , roughly that 's what my research is leading to -- a combination of chemical agents , which if administered would -Marley has just awakened to the fact that his guests aren't very happy - particularly the two nervous ladies on his either side . Also , he feels his own `` character '' attacked . MARLEY ( sputtering ) But see here - are n't you rather presumptuous in assuming there is evil in all men ? JEKYLL Of course there 's evil in all men ! He speaks the following with a peculiar faunlike glee , jabbing at them with his tone , quietly , but watching them all as he looks around the table . He 's mad now at their subborn refusal to look at the facts . 54 PAN SHOT - SLOW - AROUND TABLE 54 Jekyll 's voice comes over the stiff-lipped women and uncomfortable men . ( CONTINUED ) 28 . 54 CONTINUED : 54 JEKYLL 'S VOICE We 'd be hypocrites if we did n't admit it . We 've all had thoughts we wouldn't care to have published ... or shouted out loud . Our desires are n't always confirmed to a drawing room . As Christian we admit that Man was created weak ! It 's an honest problem . Should n't we face it ? By this time WE HOLD ON the Bishop . There is a tense silence ! BISHOP ( with gentle dignity ) Suppose we believe that Man 's soul has not yet reached its fulfillment . Is it right or wise to tamper with this problem , until its Creator has solved it - in His own mysterious way ? 55 GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL , COLONEL , BISHOP 55 The Colonel is looking across at Jekyll , trembling with austere indignation . JEKYLL ( softening a little ) My Lord - as I said before 56 CLOSE SHOT - DR. COURTNEY - 56 He draws himself up in a severe conservative huff . DR. COURTNEY Really , Jekyll - this is quite alarming . Such theories are dangerously close to a -- well , I hesitate to think what the Medical Council will be forced to say if -57 GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL 'S END OF TABLE Sir Charles looks with alarm at what Dr. Courtney is saying . JEKYLL ( with an undercurrent of heat - but smiling ) Dr. Courtney - advanced theories are always the sore-point for the Medical Council - or even a Queen 's physician . Especially if there 's a confortable profit in those already safely established . ( CONTINUED ) 57 29 . 57 CONTINUED : 57 DR. COURTNEY ( bristling ) Jekyll - if COLONEL ( suddenly exploding ) If you want my opinion , young man this is all pure balderdash ! JEKYLL ( right back at him ) Really , Colonel Weymouth ? Suppose we take your profession . What about the soldier when he comes out of battle - keyed up from the lust of killing ? What about his thoughts ? He 's lonely - bewildered . Why just recall yourself , as a young subaltern in Egypt - back from a campaign up the Nile - on a moonlit night in Cairo . What were your thoughts ? What was in your mind ? For a moment the Colonel is so moved by the glamor and nostalgia in Jekyll 's words , that his mouth is agape . COLONEL ( half remembering dim conquests ) Well , now - if you put it - I mean that 's something diff- ( then suddenly feels his wife 's eagle glare - pounds table ) Harrumph ! By Gad , sir ! I 've heard enough ! 58 CLOSE SHOT - MRS. MARLEY 58 She pushes her chair back in the sudden silence , rises with a sugary little murmur . MRS. MARLEY Ladies ... ? 59 FULL SHOT - ROOM 59 As the ladies rise , and leave , the men standing . LADY COOPER ( as they go ) Oh , I meant to ask . Has anybody seen Wilde 's new play , `` The Ideal Husband '' ? ( CONTINUED ) 30 . 59 CONTINUED : 59 MRS. FRENCH Oh , yes - at the Haymarket - a little so-so for my taste but then MRS. ARNOLD The pantomime at the Lane is magnificent . Dan [ ... ] is screamingly funny . MRS. COURTNEY Yes . And have you seen Irving 's `` King Arthur '' ... Superb ... 60 TWO SHOT - BEATRIX AND JEKYLL ( OVER THIS ) 60 As she rises she gives him a little smile which means `` I'mwith-you '' , perhaps even purses her lips at him quickly as WE PAN her away with the other women . 61 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 61 He looks after her , raises his eyebrow with a dry grin and shrugs his shoulders . 62 CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 62 He is looking from Jekyll to Beatrix o.s. , a worried look of disapproval in his expression , as we , DISSOLVE TO : 63 FULL SHOT - CARRIAGE - EXT STREET - NIGHT 63 It clops along with two horses , footman and driver on box . 64 FULL SHOT - INT . CARRIAGE - LATER 64 Beatrix sits between Jekyll and Sir Charles on the back seat . Lanyon sits on the jump seat . Sir Charles looks silent and worried . All are aware of this . WE ONLY HEAR the clop-clop of the horses . Beatrix suddenly puts her hand over her Father 's . BEATRIX ( affectionately ) Tired , Father darling ... ? SIR CHARLES Hm ? Oh - no , no .

DR. LANYON Well , Sir Charles , it 's been a long evening , so I imagine you SIR CHARLES Oh , no - no . You must come in for a night-cap , John . ( with a smile ) If you do n't think the rest of the company will be bored with each other . Jekyll and Bee look at each other with relieved smiles . DR. LANYON Well - thank you , sir . Just one . They all move toward the house , as we PAN , and DISSOLVE TO : 66 FULL SHOT - INT . DRAWING ROOM 66 It is excellently and richly appointed in the style of the period . Some French doors open off into a conservatory to one side . Lanyon is pouring the drinks from a tray . Beatrix and Jekyll are across the room at a music box , looking for some discs . Sir Charles is looking in a humidor for cigars . 66A TWO SHOT - JEKYLL AND BEATRIX 66A Jekyll is looking at a disc . JEKYLL What about this - ? BEATRIX ( whispering ) No .... this She looks affectionately o.s . toward her Father . ( CONTINUED ) 32 . 66A CONTINUED : 66A JEKYLL ( puzzled - in same voice ) What - ? BEATRIX ( whispering ) This is the one that makes Father wind his watch . ( she puts it on and it starts a lovely waltz ) ) Look - THEY BOTH LOOK 66B PAN SHOT - SIR CHARLES 66B He raises his eyes from the humidor at the first strains . He seems to think back for a second . THEN WE PAN HIM as he walks slowly to grandfather 's clock . Beside the clock is a portrait of a lovely woman , obwiously Beatrix 's mother by her looks . Sir Charles takes out his watch and winds it , but he does not look at it . He is looking up at the picture , not the clock . 66C CLOSE SHOT - PICTURE 66C 66D CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 66D His eyes are a little misty , as he looks o.s . at the picture . 66E TWO SHOT - BEATRIX AND JEKYLL As they watch Sir Charles o.s . BEATRIX ( to Jekyll ) It is the waltz that he and Mama first danced together . JEKYLL ( touched ) Oh ... ( turns to Beatrix , with a little bow ) May I have the honor , Miss Beatrix ? BEATRIX ( curtseying ) With pleasure , Dr. Jekyll . He takes her in his arms , and they waltz through the French doors into the conservatory . 66E 33 . 67 CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 67 He turns from the picture and watches them waltz o.s . 68 EFFECT SHOT - SIR CHARLES ' ANGLE - BEATRIX AND JEKYLL 68 They waltz , framed in the French doors . 68A CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 68A He smiles a little wistfully , touched by his memories . 68B BACK TO BEATRIX AND JEKYLL - HIS ANGLE 68B They dance o.s . into the part of the conservatory hidden from his view . 69 CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 69 His wistful expression turns to one of worry . Lanyon appears INTO SCENE , carrying two glasses , hands one to Sir Charles . DR. LANYON Sir Charles ... ( raising his glass ) Your health , sir . SIR CHARLES Hm ? Oh , yes , John - thank you , sir . He raises his glass , then drinks , then looks o.s . toward conservatory again , worried . 70 EFFECT SHOT - BEATRIX AND JEKYLL - INT . CONSERVATORY They are in each other 's arms , in a long embrace . WE ARE SHOOTING from the middle of the round , glass-domed room , through ferns and foliage . The waltz plays dimly o.s . Their lips part . JEKYLL Where 's our melody - when first we met ? We have n't got any .... They start walking around the rotunda and WE PAN . BEATRIX Oh , yes we have . It is n't when you meet . It 's when you know . JEKYLL Know what ? ( CONTINUED ) 70 34 . 70 CONTINUED : 70 BEATRIX That the world 's spinning around just for two people alone . JEKYLL When do two people know a thing like that ? BEATRIX Oh ... just about a month ago - on a high hill in Scotland .. JEKYLL Oh , yes . I know that hill ... Pretty close to Heaven , is n't it ? BEATRIX Right there . Right on the outskirts .... JEKYLL ( as though suddenly remembering ) I was there about that time - with a girl of all things ! BEATRIX Was the heather very high - and the clouds very low above their heads - ? JEKYLL Hmmm - yes - but what I remember most was the way the wind caught the absurd little ringlets in her hair . ( touching around her ear ) Right about there . She stops and turns to him . BEATRIX See ? That 's our melody . JEKYLL ( nodding ) Uh-hm . They kiss again . She looks at him a second , then draws away and starts fingering a flower . BEATRIX Harry ...

JEKYLL What , Bee ? 72 TWO SHOT - BEATRIX AND JEKYLL 72 BEATRIX ( slowly ) T ) Onight at dinner ... I understand what you said about good and evil in people - and that it 's that way in all of us ... but if good and evil are so closely related in us chained , as you said - why is n't - ? . ( then she stops with a little laugh , and a shake of her head , turning from him fingering flower again ) Oh , no - it sounds so ... silly - and wrong , even ... JEKYLL ( tenderly ) This is you and I . Remember us ? Nothing you and I can ever discuss will be wrong .... BEATRIX Well then , why - why you and I feel about mean ... ( hesitates , then direct , serious There 's nothing evil there ? is n't the way each other - ? I with warmth ) in that , is Jekyll laughs tenderly , and takes her hand in his . JEKYLL Look here . You and I are in love . Such a small word for such a great thing ! ( MORE ) ( CONTINUED ) 36 . 72 CONTINUED : 72 JEKYLL ( CONT 'D ) But whatever it is , it 's a blessed thing , Bee . It makes us one strong , living soul . And it takes whatever power - or even whatever secret delight that there is in evil - and turns it all into good . ( searching her eyes ) Do I have to tell you that .... ? BEATRIX Oh , no - ! She surges into his arms . They kiss passionately , then look at each other , speechless for a moment . JEKYLL ( suddenly ) What in the world are we doing ? Here we are -- bound hand and heart in some ridiculous long engagement -just because it 's the conventional correct thing to -BEATRIX Oh , I know , my darling - I don't want to wait , either .

( CONTINUED ) 37 . 72 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) 72 SIR CHARLES I 'm not one to brood about and all that -- but you must have noticed my attitude coming home this evening . JEKYLL Why , sir - I merely thought that SIR CHARLES That amazing flight of fancy you put forth at dinner ... I must confess it startled me -- and even though I 'm a broad-minded man , myself -- it was a little shocking , too ... JEKYLL Well , I 'm sorry , Sir Charles - because I assure you it was n't a flight of fancy at all . SIR CHARLES You mean you actually were in earnest ? JEKYLL Profoundly so , sir . In fact , I'm arranging to spend all my time at it -SIR CHARLES This is distressing , Harry -JEKYLL ( puzzled at his attitude ) Why ? SIR CHARLES It 's absolutely hair-brained , in my opinion . JEKYLL ( a little stung ) I 'm sorry you feel that way . I've just been explaining it further to Bee . She understands . SIR CHARLES ( stiffening - but in gentle reminder ) There are some things no gentlewoman should understand . ( CONTINUED ) 38 . 72 CONTINUED : ( 3 ) 72 JEKYLL Oh , come now , sir . In this day and age we 're surely getting beyond all that sort of - ( breaking off ) Besides , Bee and I are adults , sir we 're deeplyin love - and very close . That 's why we see no need to wait . We want to be married as soon as possible . We both feel that -SIR CHARLES I thought we decided on February . JEKYLL But that 's months away ! We need each other now . I want her near me with me - in all the work I 'm going to -SIR CHARLES No , no , Harry - I ca n't discuss any change in the plans . After this evening , more than JEKYLL But , Sir Charles -SIR CHARLES Harry ! Restraint is wise and healthy in all matters ... A sort of proving ground . I waited five years for Beatrix 's mother . JEKYLL ( with a wry smile ) If you 'll forgive me , sir -- you were a very sturdy man . SIR CHARLES ( laughing ) Well , I 'm not asking that of you but , come now , Harry . I'we always wanted a son - and now you 're going to be that . So listen to me , my boy . You 're a coming man in your profession . I 'm proud of you .

SIR CHARLES ' HOUSE 74 Lanyon and Jekyll are just coming down the steps and turning into the walk along the street as WE PAN AND TRUCK with them . Jekyll is silent and moody . DR. LANYON ( noticing his mood ) What 's up ? You and the old boy cross swords ? JEKYLL ( dryly ) It seems that I should give up my research - and carry on with taking out little Reggie Smith 's adenoids and giving Lady Gwendolyn St. Clair a sugar pill for her perennial selfinduced hysteria - or else encounter the serious disapproval of Bee's father . DR. LANYON ( laughing ) Oh , it ca n't be that bad , Harry . But you did cut up a bit rough at the Marley 's , you know . Jekyll stops , turning to him . ( CONTINUED ) 40 . 74 CONTINUED : 74 JEKYLL ( a little sharply ) I 'm not asking you to agree with me . I just have a decision to make , that's all . DR. LANYON Now , look , Harry - you and I have been friends for years . I ca n't agree with your theories - but that needn't break up our friendship , you know . I have n't seen anything of you lately . ( taking his arm ) Come on - let 's drop down to the club and play a rubber of whist . Do you good . JEKYLL ( moodily ) I 'll walk that far with you ...

At this point they cross the entrance to a narrow mews ( alley ) and WE HOLD as sounds of a struggle and cries come from its darkened recess . GIRL 'S VOICE ( O.S . ) Let me go , you - ! Why you filthy - ! Help - ! Jekyll and Lanyon both look down the mews , then dart o.s . toward the sound . 76 GROUP SHOT - IN MEWS 76 Jekyll and Lanyon rush into SCENE to find a hulk of a struggling unpleasantly with young girl .

GIRL dusting off her dress - hardly noticing him ) It 'd take more than a bloke like that to - ( suddenly sees him for first time , impressed by his looks and attire , in almost childish admiration ) Oh .. !

GIRL ( now all to Jekyll ) I know what 's what . You have to if you 're a barmaid . I like a bit of fun , as the saying goes . But when a bloke grabs you sudden-like with nasty notions in his head , it 's time to put your foot down .

( then points to where garter has left a red mark above her knee ) But I 'll tell you one thing , young lady . You wear that garter too tight . Bad . Stops the circulation . The girl looks down and then looks up at him , pathetically happy that he is this solicituous about her at least . She rises and grabs his hands . GIRL There ! You see now ? You did find something . You are my doctor , aren't you ? ( as he only smiles at her , then : ) I ought to pay you a fee ... JEKYLL ( a little caught ) I have n't presented any bill ... GIRL ( handing him garter ) How about this ? To begin with ... ( as he looks at it ) Not that it 's enough . JEKYLL Some people do n't pay half as much -GIRL It do n't seem near enough to me - !

LANYON ( sardonically ) Yours . According to your theory , I imagine that graphic tableau I just witnessed was the momentary triumph of the evil in your soul over the good . Correct ? JEKYLL ( after a second's thought ) Why ... yes . Not quite a triumph ... ( with a serious little smile ) But it was an attack .

It smokes and swirls strangely . He holds the vial a second . He looks at the letter to Beatrix , leaning in a prominent position on the table . 142 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL AT MIRROR 142 Holding the vial , he examines his face , feels his skin , turning his head . He starts to raise the vial to his lips . Then he gets another thought . WE PULL BACK AND PAN LEFT AND RIGHT IN LONG SHOTS as he puts vial back on table , runs to the drapes at the back of the lab , pulls them to , over the windows , then dashes up the stairs and locks the door . He comes down again , approaches the vial , slowly , picks it up . For a moment , he looks straight ahead into the CAMERA , as though into the future . Then down the vial with one long gulp . For a second , nothing happens . Then he grips his throat in a violent convulsion , he chokes , groans , and gags . He can hardly breathe . Slowly , his face starts to change into a haggard and horrible caricature of himself . He spins around a couple of times , then falls to the floor , writhing . THE CAMERA ZOOMS down into his body , and is blacked out , as we , DISSOLVE TO : A142 SERIES OF STATIC DISSOLVES These to Jekyll's whirring come the A142 show the tortured metamorphosis in the splitting of soul : In a spinning maelstrom of odd mechanical sounds , rasping and cacophonous noises and odd shapes faces and voices of the following : 1 .

We ask as WE PAN UP WITH HIM , his back like an animal 's in a crouch . The top of his head is strangely elongated , his ears are pointed . As yet we do not see his face but FOLLOW HIM as he slowly shuffles , gasping and grunting to the mirror . There over his shoulder , we get a look at his face for the first time . It is hideous in its transformation into Evil , yet withal containing a strange fascinating Pan-like quality . At first he starts , as though an animal looking in the mirror for the first time . Then he peers closer . And he starts to laugh , slowly , softly at first , then mounting to loud yelps . JEKYLL ( into mirror - like eyeing a work of great art ) Look at you ... look at you ... what beautiful consumate evil ! ( shouting exultantly ) There you are ! And I made you ! What a rainbow of unspeakable colors could you paint the world 's horizon if I turned you loose ! ( laughs louder , triumphantly now ) There it is , Sir Charles ! Look at it , John Lanyon !

POOLE Who is that in there ? Dr. Jekyll answer me , sir ! Dr. Jekyll -- !

Jekyll closes the door , as Poole exits o.s . 154 FULL SHOT - LAB 154 Jekyll comes down the stairs in the b.g . He is stunned by this announcement from Poole . Mechanically , dazed , he starts putting on his tail coat . Then with a sudden rush of thought , as WE PAN , he rushes to the mirror again , examines his face to see if any of the awful evil is left . He feels his cheek , his brow , his ear . He covers his face with his hand , in revulsion at what he had seen earlier . Then he looks at himself again .

Half way up he hesitates , then proceeds more slowly , as we DISSOLVE TO : 155 FULL SHOT - INT .

Beatrix is seated , nervous and anxious . She turns quickly , as Jekyll opens the door from the hall , in the b.g . Jekyll 's attitude is one of hesitancy at first , as though awaiting some feared reaction from her . BEATRIX ( quickly ) Then you 're not - ? Harry , what 's the ? ( on this she is starting over towards him , then stops , looking at him - his attitude is tense , strained as though she knew something . Then she gives him a puzzled little smile , feels her temple ) I ca n't explain why ... but I had a strange feeling you were going away without ever seeing me again ... is n't that silly ?

JEKYLL Oh , yes , Bee - yes ! BEATRIX ( with a soft smile ) You 're glad I 'm here then ? Jekyll sweeps her into his arms . Holds her almost desperately close . In this gesture , her cape falls to the floor . JEKYLL Glad ? I 'd have come to you , I think if you had n't -- I mean - tonight , somehow , I missed you more than ever ... BEATRIX ( her lips against his cheek ) When I 'm in this house , I wo n't let you waste your nights in that stuffy old laboratory ... You know that , do n't you - hmmm ... ?

Then , quietly : ) Yes , Father .... ? WE PAN OVER slowly to pick up Sir Charles standing in the open door-way . Behind him in the hall is Poole , nervously wringing his hands . Poole ducks o.s. , as Sir Charles comes slowly into the room , as WE PAN , and confronts Beatrix and Jekyll . Without a word , he leans down , picks up Beatrix's cape and hands it to her . SIR CHARLES ( in a quiet , cold voice to Jekyll ) I am very grateful for the anxiety you caused us this evening ( to Beatrix ) I was unable to sleep myself . JEKYLL Sir Charles , I asked Beatrix to come here tonight -BEATRIX ( reproving him ) Harry - you -JEKYLL ( gently ) Bee - ( to Sir Charles ) Because I -SIR CHARLES ( to Jekyll ) Apparently you did n't consider our talk the other evening very seriously ?

He looks at her for a long time . JEKYLL ( finally ) I do n't want you to go away , Bee . But - even though you and I can't agree with him - your Father is only thinking of your happiness . I can't disrespect him in that . I ca n't ask you to . There is a moment of silence . Beatrix sees that Jekyll means it . SIR CHARLES ( with a relieved sigh , more gently now ) That 's highly commendable , Harry . Beatrix now tries to smile . She offers her hand to Jekyll . BEATRIX ( fighting tears ) You - you 'll see us off at the train ? JEKYLL ( taking her hand nodding ) It better have two engines - or I'll try to hold it back . BEATRIX Try anyway .

Poole comes back and gives glass to Jekyll . Jekyll starts reading letter avidly , holding wine in his hand . Poole moves o.s . 167 CLOSE SHOT - POOLE 167 As he comes to a desk , and starts straightening things up . He wants to talk , to cheer his master up .

Jekyll quickly turns the page , anguished . 169 INSERT - BEATRIX 'S LETTER - IN JEKYLL 'S HAND 169 ( LINES ARE FROM TOP OF PAGE ) '' ... did not write yesterday because I 'm so distressed .

Might I suggest that you pick up and go out this evening for a bit of fun ? They say there 's a very entertaining musical comedy at the Gaiety ( with a little cough ) - er - ah - , very daring , you know , sir - Jekyll considers this a moment , looking at Poole . Then : JEKYLL ( dryly ) I 'm afraid that 's not particularly becoming in my position , Poole ( then with a sardonic chuckle ) ) Nor even wise , I might add .... He rubs his face in his hands . POOLE Another glass of sherry wine , sir ? JEKYLL ( face in his hands , wearily ) No thank you , Poole ... POOLE Yes , sir . Poole exits from scene , with tray and broken glass . We hear him go upstairs o.s . and close the door . Then Jekyll gets up with sudden impatience . WE PAN HIM as he walks about the room . He fiddles with a tube or two , straightening it absently . He finds a pipe on the table , knocks it out . He feels in his pocket for tobacco pouch . Does n't find it . He walks over by the cabinet . 70 . 171 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 171 He is looking for his pouch , when suddenly , his eyes catches something o.s . 172 CLOSE SHOT - IVY 'S GARTER 172 It is still where Jekyll must have tossed it weeks ago . Its cheap little clasp , glistens in the lamplight . 173 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 173 Fascinated , he slowly bends over and picks it up . He feels it in his hand . He thinks of the girl . Then he quickly throws it on the table . WE PAN HIM as he paces the length of the room again , nervously . This brings him opposite the mirror . He looks at himself then thinks , looks back at the garter , then over at a cabinet . Then he makes his decision , and hurries to the cabinet , pulling out some vials of powders and liquids from various pigeon-holes . As he hastily carries them to the lab table and sits himself down to mix them , we DISSOLVE TO : 174 CLOSE SHOT - FINISHED POTION 174 As Jekyll 's hand picks it up WE PAN to his face . He hesitates a second , looks at the garter nearby , then with a desperate gesture he drains the potion . The same reaction sets in as before . In violent convulsions , his face starts to turn . He grips the sides of the chair in agony . WE PAN DOWN to his hand . It turns into an animal-like appendage . His four fingers seem to grow together a little bit at the base , and then separate in the middle , almost like the beginning of a cloven hoof . His neck becomes thick and shorter . WE PAN UP to his face . It is worse than before . WE PAN DOWN to the other hand . The same process is happening here . He is gasping and writhing all the while . WE PAN UP again to his face . The transformation now becomes complete . It is worse in this second stage - more bestial than faun . His writhing stops . He rises , shakes his head - feels the change in his thoughts . ( NOTE : The question of each metamorphosis and its subsequent gradations according to makeup is open to debate so that all parties concerned in the production agree and are satisfied ) GIRL 'S VOICE ( on track , whispering ) It 's in your eyes - it 's in your eyes ... He hurries over to the mirror to look . He is truly this Mr. Hyde now , whom he spoke about to Poole . ( CONTINUED ) 71 . 174 CONTINUED : 174 HYDE ( into mirror , gleefully ) Yes , Mr. Hyde ! Wonderful , Mr. Hyde ! It is ! You are the modern Narcissus ! Your face reflects man 's Eternity as it was meant to be ! He leaps away from the mirror , stretches himself like an animal in the middle of the room , thinks again . GIRL 'S VOICE ( whispering ) ( with a low laugh ) Caught , aren't you ? You 're caught ... HYDE ( suddenly , exultantly ) No ! I 'm free ! Free ! He capers about a second , then quickly takes his cape , stick and hat from a hanger , and darts out the back door . 175 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - EXT . BACK OF LAB 175 He takes a key out of his pocket , and locks the door . Then he turns and looks about him . He takes off his hat and stretches again in the rain , looking up into the elements . Then he darts off into the darkness as we DISSOLVE TO : 176 FULL SHOT - INT . ROOMING HOUSE HALL 176 We are SHOOTING TOWARD front door on which somebody is banging furiously on the outside . The slatternly landlady hurriedly comes down the steps , opens door . She jumps back with a startled cry as Hyde barges in . HYDE ( his eyes agleam ) Is she here ? Is she in ? LANDLADY ( back up stairs a way ) Who ? Who do you want ? HYDE ( pointing ) The dove - the little white dove that nests in her warm loft up there ? LANDLADY ( as he starts up steps ) If it 's Ivy Pearson you want - she she ai n't in . ( CONTINUED ) 72 . 176 CONTINUED : 176 HYDE ( thinking over the name ) ( coming down ) Ivy , eh ? Ivy ... ( with a sly laugh poking her with stick ) Clinging , no doubt , too .... ( then , impatiently ) Come , come - you leaf of jaded lettuce ! Where is she ? Where does she work ? LANDLADY At the Palace of Varieties ! HYDE Ah ! At the Palace of Varieties ! What a shallow hearth for the fire of my lovely jewel ! ( then , cocking his head to one side ) But - variety , eh ? Variety ! I like that ! With a caper , he pokes the landlady in her backside with his stick , and dashes out of the door . 177 CLOSE SHOT - CURB - EXT . IVY 'S PLACE 177 Hyde comes out , gleeful at the prospect of finding Ivy . He comes abreast of an old blind man who is timidly tapping his stick on the curb , preparatory to crossing the street . Hyde takes his arm with exaggerated solicitation . HYDE Why , why ! Let me give you a hand , Uncle ! BLIND MAN ( with a happy smile ) Oh ... thank you , sir ! WE TRUCK AHEAD OF THEM across the street . They weave their way past a couple of drays . Then , in the middle of the street , Hyde kicks the old man 's stick out from under him . HYDE ( laughing gleefully ) There you are , Uncle - safe and sound ! ( CONTINUED ) 73 . 177 CONTINUED : 177 The old man exclaims inarticulately - `` Here - no - no - '' and gropes about for his stick which Hyde flicks farther away along the cobbles with his own . A cart nearly runs the old man down , the driver pulling up with a jerk as the old man reels backwards . Hyde utters another happy laugh , and WE PAN HIM as he crosses the street and capers down the walk to where a cab is standing near the intersection of a neuse . 178 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 178 As he climbs into hansom , he taps the nodding driver with his stick . HYDE Come , come - my dozing fungus - ! ( as Cabbie wakes up quickly ) To the Palace of Varieties ! CABBIE Right , sir ! HYDE ( wacking horse 's right rump with cane ) Right , sir ! ( then whacking left ) Left , sir ! ( then whacking center ) And a bit down the middle , sir ! Naturally , the horse leaps to action during this as WE PAN CARRIAGE AWAY , AND DISSOLVE TO : 179 FULL SHOT - EXT . PALACE OF VARIETIES 179 It is the facade of the average cheap music hall of the period . Hyde leaps out of the cab as it comes to a stop . He looks at the place with eager interest , then turns to hand the Cabbie his fare . As the latter reaches down for the money , Hyde has the sudden caprice to pull him tumbling off his seat , rolling him on the pavement . Hyde throws the money on top of him and then pokes him with his stick . HYDE ( capering about ) Whee ! All the king 's horses and all the king 's men ! A couple of hangers-on in front rush up . A passer-by stops . ( CONTINUED ) 74 . 179 CONTINUED : 179 1ST HANGER-ON ( as though to detain Hyde ) Here , here , Guv'nor - what 's the - ? Hyde turns and men jump back , see . Then Hyde box office , as raises his stick , with a growl of rage . The scared at the expression of viciousness they chuckles , and darts on into the music hall we DISSOLVE TO : 180 FULL SHOT - INT . PALACE OF VARIETIES 180 A smoke-filled Utopia with a bar at one end , a stage at the other . Along the side , boxes with tables and chairs - and tables and chairs ranging on an incline from the stage back towards the bar . The `` chairman '' at his table down front is conducting the proceedings on the stage , a row of plump soubrettes in a song and dance ensemble to the tune of '' Champagne Charlie '' . WE SEE Hyde come in in the b.g . 181 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 181 He comes in , stands a moment , smelling the wind like an expectant ram . A waiter approaches him , sees his quality attire . Hyde hands him his ticket . WAITER Ah , yes , sir - Box F , sir . WE PAN THEM through the tables and up some small steps around in back of a box which Hyde enters . The waiter stands , expecting an order , as Hyde 's eyes dart about , savoring the place . The waiter is now a little leery of Hyde 's looks and wants to please . WAITER A brandy and soda , sir ? HYDE ( with a grunt , nodding his head ) Hmph . The waiter exits . Hyde continues to sweep the room with his look . 182 PAN SHOT - HYDE 'S ANGLE - THE PLACE Hyde 's glance travels about slowly , enjoying each group . IT HOLDS at a table where a young man is kissing the neck of his girl friend . She pretends to repulse him . 182 75 . 183 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 183 He likes this . He shifts happily in his chair . He looks toward the stage . 184 PAN SHOT - LINE OF SOUBRETTES - HYDE 'S ANGLE 184 We travel down the line of hard-working young ladies . They lift their limbs in a sort of can-can . 185 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 185 This pleases him no end . He lifts his stick and rotates it like the limbs of the girls . The waiter appears with the brandy and soda , puts it down . WAITER ( elaborately ) Yes , sir . Hyde picks up the glass , starts to drink , and just then notices something o.s . His eyes light up . 186 EFFECT SHOT - HIS ANGLE - IVY 186 She is behind the bar , laughing and joking with two or three men . The reason Hyde can see her is that she is standing on a stool , reaching up for a bottle at the back of the bar , as she looks back at the men below . We can not hear what she is saying , naturally . 187 TWO SHOT - HYDE AND WAITER 187 Hyde notices waiter 's presence . HYDE ( barking ) What are you waiting for ? ( as waiter starts to stutter ) A tip , eh ? Get out ! The waiter ducks quickly , and Hyde looks again toward Ivy o.s . WE PULL BACK to INCLUDE waiter as he rounds box and starts down steps . WAITER ( grumbling ) Blighter ! Hyde swings his cane over the box in front of the waiter , tripping him . ( CONTINUED ) 76 . 187 CONTINUED : 187 HYDE ( as he does so ) Eh ? ( to waiter on floor ) Mind your tongue and send me a bottle of champagne . ( gesturing o.s . ) Have her bring it - that girl up there ! WAITER ( sullenly ) Ivy ? Ivy ai n't allowed to leave the bar . At this point , a fat little manager comes INTO SCENE . HYDE ( with slow ominousness ) I said ! MANAGER ( very officious ) Here - here . What 's all this here about ? WAITER This gent here wants champagne . MANAGER Champagne ? Well , bring it , man bring it ! WAITER But he wants Ivy to serve it - ! MANAGER Of course , she 'll serve it ! Jump now ! ( turns to Hyde as waiter slinks off ) Anything to oblige a gentleman , sir ! But Hyde takes no notice of him , as he keeps looking o.s . at Ivy . 188 GROUP SHOT - AROUND IVY AT BAR She is still kidding her . obviously on by her skirt 188 on the stool , reaching up . The two men are She is playing up to them . Their eyes are her ankles and lower limbs as they are revealed lifting a little when she stretches .

IVY This - up here - ? 2ND MAN ( nudging his companion ) No , no - up higher , Ivy love - the Red Label Walker - ! IVY Higher , eh ? You are a one ! ( drops down and pushes him playfully in the chest ) Your missus has got a pair of ankles . Go home and look at them ! By this time the waiter has come to bar . WAITER ( to Ivy ) There 's a gent in Box F what wants you to serve him and old Figg says you 're to do it . IVY ( airily ) Oh , he does , eh ? Well , tell him it a i n't my business to -WAITER He wants a bottle of the boy . IVY ( happily surprised ) Oh ! Bubbly ! Why did n't you say so ? She takes a bottle of champagne from a box of cracked ice behind bar . Puts it on a tray . 1ST MAN ( during this ) Hey , Ivy love - what about some fish and chips after the show ? 2ND MAN What about a dozen oysters and a pint of stout ? Ivy very meaningly puts a second glass on the tray . ( CONTINUED ) 78 . 188 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) 188 IVY What about a glass of champagne ? She picks up tray with bottle and glasses and flounces down the bar and out , as the two men look after her . 189 CLOSE SHOT - CHAIRMAN 189 He turns to the crowd as another chorus of the song starts . CHAIRMAN ( calling out ) Everybody now ! All together ! ` Oh ! Champagne Charlie is my -- ! ' He leads the crowd as they all start to sing . 190 PAN SHOT - IVY 190 As she approaches box . She adopts a casual air , singing as she goes , pretending little interest in the man in the box o.s. , as WE PAN HER UP the steps and around into the box . She puts down tray as Hyde looks at her avidly . She has not yet got a good look at him , only sensing his expensive attire , as she opens the bottle and sings at the same time . Then she turns as though to smile casually at the customer , and gets Hyde 's full look , sees him for the first time , and stops singing , staring at him . Then she looks away , starts singing again , only not very happily now , and then pours only one glass , as she finally ceases singing entirely . The song stops , and there are applause and shouts o.s . IVY ( wanting to get away ) That 'll be half a quid , sir . HYDE ( giving her a note ) Here 's a sovereign , my dear ... the change is yours . IVY ( impressed ) Thank you , sir . Yet she looks at him again and still decides to go . Hyde gets up quickly and touches her elbow . HYDE Oh , but now ! You brought two glasses . You must have had the same thought as I . What a nice beginning , eh ? ( pulls out chair and edges her into it ) Sit down , my dear - yes - sit down .... ( CONTINUED ) 79 . 190 CONTINUED : 190 He pours the other glass of wine for her . IVY ( nervously , watching him ) I 'll take just a sip . Then I 'll have to go back because I 'm -HYDE Nonsense - we 've got all evening , little Ivy . I like your singing . You 'll have to sing for me some more . Where did you get such a pretty voice .... ? IVY ( fooling with glass ) Why - I dunno .... I just -HYDE Is it because of the pretty place it comes from - ? ( starting to touch under her chin ) That 's very lovely .... where it comes from .... Ivy quickly picks up her glass , to interfere with his gesture . IVY Well - good - good luck , sir . HYDE I make my own luck , my dear - ( lifting his glass to her ) And tonight I follow the rainbow .... IVY ( with a nervous laugh ) You do talk , do n't you ? HYDE ( leaning closer to her ) We 'll follow it together , eh ? He holds her gaze for a second . Then : IVY ( decisively ) I follow it right home , mister . ( CONTINUED ) 80 . 190 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) 190 HYDE To what end , my dear ? That fetid stable you call home ? You - with your young radiance -- are happy living in that rat-trap ? IVY ( pertly ) What do you expect ? Buckingham Palace ? Hyde throws back his head and laughs . HYDE Touche ' , my dear . I like that ! IVY ( suddenly ) Here ! How do you know where I live ? HYDE ( caught ) Why , I - ( then , easily ) I can only imagine . I 'll warrant your wages here wo n't afford you a mansion in Kensington . IVY ( as he leans closer ) ` Struth - they do n't ! ( starting to rise ) Well , I must be off because -HYDE ( holding her arm ) Why ? You act frightened of me , little Ivy .... ( rising with her , still holding her arm - softly ) You must n't be frightened of me .... Ivy stares at him a second , almost in a spell because of his voice and touch . Then , she suddenly wrenches herself away . IVY ( as she does so ) I ai n't afraid of nobody - but leggo , you hear ? At this point , the first man who was at the bar , enters . He is quite tight and annoyed . He grabs Ivy 's other arm . 1ST MAN What 's he doin ' , Ivy ? ( CONTINUED ) 81 . 190 CONTINUED : ( 3 ) 190 IVY ( wrenching away from him also ) And you leggo , too : As she ducks out of the box , she bumps into the second man at the bar , who has followed the first . The latter is quite drunk . 2ND MAN Hey ! What 's all this about ? HYDE ( pointing to first man ) He insulted the poor child ! He mauled her ! 1ST MAN Do n't listen to -2ND MAN ( eyeing first ) He did , eh ? HYDE You saw him -- he nearly broke her wrist ! We were sitting here having a For answer the second man swings on the first and knocks him over the rail of the box and onto a table , beneath where sit four or five men and a couple of girls . The place goes in an uproar . 2ND MAN ( leaning over rail , to first ) You will , eh ? Hyde 's eyes light up at the fracas . He shoves the second man over the low rail with a lightning movement , and stands laughing at the turmoil below . 191 FULL SHOT - FIGHT It starts as one of the men swings on the first who has fallen . AD LIB Here ! What 's the idea ? Give it to him , Fred ! Wh 're you shovin ' ? Let him have it ! You take that one ! Etc . The fight becomes general in the area below Hyde 's box , as he watches gleefully . Women scream . Glasses and bottles crash . 191 82 . 192 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 192 He jumps up and down at the rail , watching the fight like an animal , gleefully giggling as he sees the heavy punching and falling . At one point a man is backed up against the rail . Hyde puts his foot through and kicks him sprawling . 193 PAN SHOT - MANAGER 193 The fat little man comes hurrying into the fight , elbowing his way through . MANAGER ( calling over his shoulder ) Fred - Joe - ! ( to fighting crowd ) Here , here now - stop this ! I'll stop it ! As he comes abreast of Hyde , Hyde 's eyes gleam as he spies the Manager 's . Then , with elaborate but quick prankishness , Hyde uses his stick like a billiard cue , shooting it on the rail , letting the manager have it right in the side of the eye , then jumps up and down with laughter as the manager goes down , and we DISSOLVE TO : 194 TWO SHOT - INT . MANAGER 'S OFFICE 194 The manager is applying a cold towel and a piece of raw meat to his eye which is quite puffed . In the b.g . through the door , we see the activity of the place . Hyde watches him . MANAGER ... frightful . We run a very orderly hall here . I do n't understand what happened . HYDE Ir 's that girl , Ivy ... that barmaid . Girls like that always cause trouble . You should discharge her . MANAGER ( surprised ) Ivy ? Why , no ! She brings half the customers in here -HYDE I said discharge her !

Five pounds ? Why - why - yes yes - I think you 're quite right , sir . Trouble-maker , that 's what she is . Out she goes , sir . HYDE ( starting to go ) At once , you hear ?

MANAGER Then be off ! IVY Good riddance ! He slams the door in her face and she comes toward the CAMERA , flouncing her indignation . As she gets opposite the cab , Hyde steps out and confronts her .

( guides her to cab and helps her in ) The rainbow is wide and long , little Ivy .... Ivy allows him to do this , fascinated as much by his easy manner as by the sudden wealth in her hands . 196 FULL SHOT - INT . CAB 196 Ivy gets in , followed quickly by Hyde , who shuts the door . But Ivy now feels imprisoned as Hyde sits close to her . She starts to rise , undecided , as though to get out . IVY Now , wait . Half a mo ' , mister -HYDE ( quickly , holding her on seat ) No , no ... you do n't belong in there , anyhow -- serving cheap gin to cattle !

WE PULL BACK TO find her seated on the terrace at a table with Sir Charles outside of the `` pump room '' at Aix Les Bains . Sir Charles is opening some letters .

Beatrix turns the page of her letter . 198 87 . 198A CLOSE SHOT - PAGE OF LETTER 198A '' so your letter was forwarded to me here at the Conference .

Yes , the Council should do something about it ( stops as he sees tears in her eyes ) Here , here - my dear - what 's wrong ? BEATRIX ( quickly collecting herself ) Nothing . I - I guess I 'm just not terribly interested in housing conditions .... at the moment . She tries for control with a little laugh . SIR CHARLES You mean because a man does n't cover the pages with sentimental drivel ? Nonsense ( pats her hand , gently ) You women should learn to read between the lines ...

Beatrix turns and looks at him with joyful expectance , as WE DOLLY TO A CLOSE SHOT OF HER , an DISSOLVE TO : 89 . 202 CLOSE SHOT - IVY - INT . NEW APARTMENT 202 She is a different Ivy than we last saw . She seems to be down , dull , beaten , some of her native young impudence and freshness gone . She is playing a game of solitaire . She makes a move , and winces a little , feels her shoulder , then plays on dully , as WE DRAW BACK to show her new surroundings , a rather rich , gaudy and heavy parlor of the period . In the b.g . beyond folding doors thrown open , is the bedroom and dressing table . AS WE SWING AROUND we see the front door on a landing and then a few steps with rail descend into the parlor . The door opens and Ivy jumps up quickly , stiffening , then relaxes and tries to cover up as an older girl in a peignoir and slippers comes in . IVY ( sitting down ) Oh , hello , Marcia . MARCIA ( coming down steps ) Just stepped down the hall for a chin-chin ... ( sits down opposite Ivy as WE DOLLY IN eyeing her , with a casual drawl ) You jumped as though you sat on a hot stove .

Why if ever a man dared to lay a hand to me like that I 'd -- But they both turn quickly as the door opens o.s . Ivy rises in panic . Marcia 's jaw stiffens .

HYDE But you must come when I 'm here , Marcia . Your point of view differs from mine . It would be a delicious thrill to change it .

Won't it ? On this , he snicks a grape skin right into the curly hair about her temple . It sticks there . She tries to laugh , as she picks it out . Then she quickly gets up and exits from SCENE , taking cards with her as Hyde watches her . 204 CLOSE SHOT - IVY 204 As she comes to a cabinet and starts to put cards away , staying there to re-arrange things just for something to do . 205 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 205 He watches her , smiling , swinging one leg as he sits on the table , munching more grapes . HYDE And what would my little cherub like to do this evening ? 205A CLOSE SHOT - IVY 205A She turns - a plea in her eyes . IVY Oh , sir !

( CONTINUED ) 97 . 205C CONTINUED : ( 2 ) 205C HYDE ( with scorn ) Yes - where all the toffs go - when they 're respectable . When they'd rather tell a girl her garter 's too tight than to say what 's really in their thoughts - ! IVY ( a little crestfallen ) Well , sir - I sort of hoped we could ( stops , looks at him a little puzzled as the word `` garter '' rings in her past unconscious mind ) What makes you say - ? HYDE ( quickly - gaily ) So you want to go out , eh ? IVY ( thinking this his assent ) Oh , yes , sir ! I 'll go put on my things and - ! HYDE ( sweetly ) We 're not going ! IVY ( turning back to him ) Sir - ? HYDE ( mimicking her ) Because the entertainment is ever so gay and nice right here ! He smiles at her evilly , chuckles a little . She turns away with a sudden desperate gesture , putting both hands over her brow . HYDE ( gently ) Now we 've got to think of what we'll do , do n't we ?

No , you 're probably tired of cards - ( MORE ) ( CONTINUED ) 98 . 205C CONTINUED : ( 3 ) 205C HYDE ( CONT 'D ) ( as she still stands , her face covered ) You could read to me , could n't you ? Milton 's Paradise Lost would be nice but we have n't the book here - and you do n't know it from memory , do you ? ( suddenly ) Oh ! I know . You remember what we like !

HYDE Not in good voice - ? IVY It is n't that , sir . It HYDE ( in sweet reproof ) Why ! It 's such a pretty song ! IVY ( wringing her hands , starting to sob ) Oh , please , sir - not tonight !

IVY Oh , sir - whatever you like - but for the love of - ! With a lightning-like movement , his gentle taunting turns to a fierce , vicious command as he pinches her chin between his thumb and fore-finger . His eyes widen in fury . HYDE I said sing ! IVY ( with almost a scream ) But , sir - ! HYDE Sing it ! You hear me ? Ivy slowly nods , looks about a little hysterically , backs away a little , as if to an accustomed position before him , and pathetically , between sobs , starts to sing a version of Champagne Charlie in which she substitutes the words '' Champagne Ivy is my name ... '' 205D CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 205D He leans forward on the table , watching her with horrible , rising satisfaction , swaying slightly to the music . HYDE That 's it ! Smile when you sing ! Be gay ! Be happy ! 205E CLOSE SHOT - IVY 205E As she sings , not looking at him , but everywhere else in the room that she can . As she finishes she just stands there and sobs . 205F TWO SHOT - HYDE AND IVY 205F HYDE ( as she finishes ) Bravo ! Bravo ! A prima donna is born !

With this he picks up a bunch of grapes and throws them at her . They smash against her breast , leaving a huge smear . He leaps over at her , as WE DOLLY IN CLOSE . His voice is now low and rampant with desire , as he enfolds her in his arms . HYDE Congratulations , my dear ! ... the world is yours ! The moment is mine - ! She tries to pull away from him , but he pulls her in to him savagely , and kisses her . She all but faints under it , and wilts in his arms , her whole body sagging . He looks down at her , pulls her arms about his neck , lifts her up , with a look o.s. , as we FADE OUT : 206 OUT . 206 207 FULL SHOT - EXT .

LAB 208 Hyde lights gas lamps , then takes off his cape and hat , then quickly goes to [ ... ] , picks out a vial , comes to table and pours contents into a glass . He looks about crazily for a second , then drinks it . He gets the same violent reaction as from the `` outward '' phase . He writhes , grips table , etc. , but the change is much quicker than when he changes to Hyde . Now , before our eyes , he becomes Dr. Jekyll . He seems sagging , spent . He goes quickly to the mirror and looks at himself , as WE DOLLY IN . He peers at , feels , his face anxiously , then looks at his hands . Then he looks at himself in disgust , and covers his face with his hands . He paces about a bit , silently berating himself , his lips moving , his fist pounding the table . He takes the back-door key out of his pocket , looks at it , then over at the back-door . He makes a firm decision , goes quickly to a small gas smelter , lights it , puts in a chunk of lead , holds the key in his hand , waiting . Suddenly , there is a knock on the door , o.s. , from house . POOLE 'S VOICE Dr. Jekyll , sir ? JEKYLL Oh - just a moment , Poole . ( CONTINUED ) 101 . 208 CONTINUED : 208 He hurries up the stairs , unlocks the front door , and Poole follows him down stairs . Poole has dressed only in trousers , coat and slippers . POOLE ( relieved ) I saw the light . I 'm so glad you're back , Dr. Jekyll . I was worried , sir . You 'll pardon my appearance . JEKYLL I was called on an emergency . I stayed at the house . POOLE Yes , sir . Oh , Dr. Lanyon called twice today , sir - he said to tell you that Miss Beatrix and her father arrive home in the morning , sir . JEKYLL ( starting ) In the morning ?

Goodnight , sir . ( CONTINUED ) 102 . 208 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) 208 JEKYLL Goodnight , Poole ... WE DOLLY INTO JEKYLL as he walks to the smelter . It is now molten hot and reflects on his face . He takes the key and drops it into the boiling lead . 209 INSERT - KEY 209 Dissolving into the molten lead . Jekyll watches it . A great relief comes over him , and he closes his eyes , lifting his head , as we FADE OUT . FADE IN : 210 GROUP SHOT - INT . IVY 'S PARLOR - DAY 210 Marcia is administering to Ivy 's bruises on her shoulders . Ivy is sobbing , angry and scared . Freddie , Marcia 's gentleman friend , stands by quite aghast .

Freddie nods and WE PAN HIM up the steps to the door , which he opens , showing messenger . Latter hands him the envelope . FREDDIE Any answer ? MESSENGER No , guv'nor . Freddie gives the messenger a coin , and comes down , handing the envelope to Ivy . She opens it , as they watch . She pulls out a sheaf of bank notes . IVY ( in wonder ) Look here - ! MARCIA ( picking up and counting notes ) I say ! Fifty pounds . ( looking in envelope ) But there 's no letter with it . This from him ... ? FREDDIE The blighter must 've sent it for what he 's done . IVY Not him - the rotten skinflint - and he do n't care nohow ... MARCIA ( finding a solution , practical ) Well - no matter who sent it , it's here . And it 's more than enough to get you out of the country . FREDDIE Jolly good idea ! I 've got a friend in Paris who 'll be only too glad to -IVY ( jumping up suddenly , a little wildly ) No , no ! Do n't you see ?

If I only could do it I 'd go down to the river and -- ! ( slumps down in chair again and sobs ) MARCIA It 's her nerves , that 's what . She ought to see a doctor .

Beatrix has been crying . BEATRIX ... but you should have written me . I should be the first to know when you are ill . If I 'd known you were that ill I 'd have come home at once . JEKYLL But , Bee darling - do n't you see ? I knew that and I - I did n't know what to say . I did n't want to worry you ... Beatrix wipes away a last tear , and then puts her hand on his cheek . BEATRIX Oh , my poor lamb - your face looks so drawn ... Jekyll recaptures her hand .

JEKYLL ( as they shake hands ) I hope I 'm welcome again , sir . SIR CHARLES Ca n't think of any reason why you should n't be . How 've you been ? Beatrix read me some of your letters . Interesting . BEATRIX Father , Harry wo n't admit it . But because he was so upset , he 's been very ill while we were away SIR CHARLES Oh , I 'm sorry , my boy - feeling fit again ? JEKYLL ( grinning ) With Bee back , sir ? Well ! BEATRIX ( bluntly but calmly ) And this leads me to speak very plainly , Father . It 's in my heart and I must say it . I want to be married just as soon as possible . SIR CHARLES Now , my dear - you know I said that BEATRIX Father , I respect you more than any girl could . But Harry and I - we've waited so long .

Ivy comes slowly toward him . IVY So you 're the famous Dr. Jekyll ? Now , who 'd have thought we 'd meet again like this ?

IVY Oh , I 'm so glad it 's you , sir ! You were so kind and good to me that night ! Maybe you can -JEKYLL What - ah - what brought you here , Miss Pierson ? Ivy is reminded of her plight .

Did you ever see a thing like that before , sir ? JEKYLL It 's - it 's horrible ... ( then collecting himself , starts for desk ) I 'll give you some lotion to soothe that . But Ivy stops him quickly . She begins to break down more . IVY Lotion ! It wo n't be lotions 'll do the trick , sir ! No ! It 's more than that , sir . I need help , I do ! I can't stand it any more ! ( as Jekyll can only look at her ) It 's Hyde , sir - a man I know - Mr. Hyde , sir ! It 's him as done it , and more I ca n't tell you , sir .

Why did n't you go to the police ? IVY ( looking up at him ) I tell you I 'm afraid , sir ! You do n't know him , sir . A nice fine gentleman like yourself would n't be meeting such a person ! He ai n't a man - he 's a devil ! He knows what you 're thinking about , he does ! Why , if he knows I 've been here today , I do n't know what he 'll do . It won't be nothin ' human , I can tell you ! Oh , please , sir - please help me . Keep him off - !

And for a flash second , he seems as though he is about to lean over and embrace her with the strange look of Hyde battling for supremacy in his expression . Then he contains himself and lifts her up , as he stands too . JEKYLL I - I give you my word that you will never be troubled by this man Hyde again . IVY ( sobbing anew ) But - but how do you know , sir ? He'll come back ! He 'll come back and kill me , sir ! ( CONTINUED ) 112 . 214 CONTINUED : ( 4 ) 214 JEKYLL He 'll not come back .

He starts to whistle . He is whistling `` Champagne Charlie '' ! He whistles it with great volume and vehemence . He suddenly realizes what he is whistling and stops it , a shadow crossing his face . Then he smiles again , starts whistling `` Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes '' , but before he realizes it , he is whistling `` Champagne Charlie '' again . He stops short in his tracks , as he realizes this . His hand passes over his brow . He tries to walk on , straightening his shoulders . He seems to feel faint . He looks about , a little confused , and WE PAN HIM as he goes to a round bench under a tree and sits down . 220 115 . 221 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - ON BENCH 221 He seems to be trying to get his breath . He rings his finger around the edge of his collar . Then he contorts a little . His face suddenly becomes strained and panic-stricken . His hand goes to his throat . His face starts to contort more , the lines deepening . With horror , his glance goes to his hands . WE PAN DOWN . His hand , clutching the bench , is turning more horribly grotesque than we have ever seen it . WE PAN BACK UP . Jekyll is now nearing the change to Hyde ! He looks at his other hand . WE PAN DOWN . It is the same as the other . WE PAN BACK UP to his face . It is almost that of Hyde . He is in convulsions . JEKYLL ( with a last desperate cry ) Bee - Bee , darling - ! Then the writhings and gaspings , their course running quicker than before . And suddenly , he is Hyde ! He looks about , craftily , viciously . A bird lights on the bench beside him . He flails his cane at it . It flies away . He thinks a second , getting his bearings in Evil . Then a thought strikes him . His eyes glint . He starts to sing `` Champagne Charlie '' in a horrible sing-song , swaying manner , and suddenly he gets up with an animal leap , and WE PAN HIM as he runs leaping across the green into the b.g. , like a gorged buzzard racing for another piece of carrion , as we -DISSOLVE TO : 222 CLOSE SHOT - IVY - INT .

( then softly , passionately ) And here 's hoping that Dr. Jekyll thinks of his Ivy - like I know he'd like to ... like Ivy thinks of him ... 'cause he 's an angel . Here 's to my angel ... Her glass starts for her lips , when suddenly the door opens , reflected in the b.g . Hyde stands there , staring at her . Ivy turns with a gasp of horror and disbelief , drops the glass to the floor . 222 116 . 223 PAN SHOT - HYDE 223 He comes slowly down the stairs , throwing his hat and stick on a table , eyeing the frozen Ivy all the while . He starts across to her . HYDE Surprised ? IVY ( shocked to soberness ) Why , sir - I HYDE It could n't be that you did n't expect to see me , could it ?

Because it 's such a beautiful secret that those who share it with me ca n't go on living . IVY What - what are you going to do ? HYDE ( softly ) How does one usually stop a person from living ? He makes a lunge at her , but she ducks from under him , wrenches away from his grasp and , screaming , runs across room , up the stair . Hyde gives a roar of glee and rage , leaps over balustrade and intercepts her , as WE PAN . WE PAN BACK as she runs screaming across the room , trying to get to a window . Hyde leaps back and grabs her as she reaches divan . 224 EFFECT SHOT - SHOOTING OVER DIVAN 224 Hyde grabs her by the throat , bends her back . IVY ( wild in her terror ) No - please , sir - I 'll sing for you , I will ( starts singing ) '' Champagne Ivy is my name . Champagne Ivy is -- '' Her voice chokes off . HYDE ( yelling ) Now ! Now you 've got what you've longed for ! ( they start sinking out of sight behind divan ) Here - with your angel !

After a second there is silence . Hyde gets up gasping . He looks about , looks back at form below FRAME , and then WE PAN as he picks up his hat and stick and starts for the door . O.s . in the hall , we hear inaudible but growing murmurs . 225 FULL SHOT - UPPER HALL AND STAIR WELL 225 An elderly woman and her husband , and a couple of other tenants are looking fearfully at Ivy 's door . Marcia and Freddie , both in evening dress , are hurrying up the stairs . WOMAN ( down to them ) Somethin 's happened ! He 's latherin' the hide off her ! FREDDIE ( to man above ) Come on - we better pop in and stop it ! At this moment , Hyde comes out the door on the run , stops as he sees them . MAN Hey , you - what 've you been - ? He gets no further as Hyde brushes him aside with a roar , careens down the stairs to Freddie and Marcia . WOMAN Stop him , the dirty - ! Freddie tries to grapple with Hyde , but Hyde knocks him down with a blow from his cane , and as WE PAN , leaps over the balustrade with a laugh in time to avoid other tenants who come rushing up the stairs . In the b.g. , below , he ducks out of the door . 226 FULL PAN SHOT - EXT . STREET 226 Hyde comes out of the door , darts off down the street . A couple of passers-by turn around and look at him as he leaves the sidewalk , ducks across in front of a cab , hitting the horse with his cane so that it rears and plunges , and then disappears around a corner . DISSOLVE TO : 120 . 227 GROUP SHOT - INT . IVY 'S PARLOR 227 We are shooting over back of divan . Marcia , Freddie , and other tenants are looking horrified down at a constable who is kneeling over Ivy 's body o.s . Marcia , hard Marcia , is sobbing . Freddie has his handkerchief to a bloody temple . WOMAN ( in awe ) He done her in ! How horrible ! CONSTABLE ( rising ) This here 's the work of a friend ! MARCIA ( bursting out ) It was that Hyde did it , I tell you ! The constable turns , jumps to the window , opens it , starts blowing his whistle vigorously . DISSOLVE TO : 228 FULL SHOT - EXT . BACK JEKYLL 'S LAB . 228 Hyde hurries into scene , looks about with triumphant little chuckles , as he fumbles in his pockets for the key . WE DOLLY IN . Then Hyde realizes he has destroyed the key . He tries the heavy door with his shoulder , tries again . He gives up , looks around , then WE PAN HIM as he darts along sidewalk to corner , turns , and disappears . 229 FULL SHOT - AT FRONT CORNER 229 Hyde comes running from back corner full tilt , and WE PAN HIM , after he peers around front corner of his house , along front of house to entrance and the door , in far b.g . 230 CLOSE SHOT - AT FRONT DOOR - HYDE 230 He pulls out the wire plunger bell , frantically , then bangs the heavy brass knocker on the door . He flies into a flurry of animal rage in his impatience . Then the door opens about a foot , held in that position by the heavy safety chain stretching from jamb to door on the inside , and Poole's startled face peers out . He withdraws a little at the man he sees . HYDE Come - open up , you fool ! I 'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll ! ( CONTINUED ) 121 . 230 CONTINUED : 230 POOLE D-D-Doctor Jekyll is n't at home , sir ... Poole tries to close door but Hyde pushes his foot in , wedging it open . HYDE Well , that does n't make any - ! ( then recovering ) What difference does that make ? He expects me ! He told me to wait for him , you idiot ! Let me in ! POOLE ( firmly ) I know all of Dr. Jekyll's friends - ! HYDE Now look here - I 'll have no insolent talk like POOLE You 'll have to come back later . HYDE You open up or I 'll bash this door in ! POOLE If you do n't go away , I 'll send for the police ! As he says this , he stamps on Hyde 's foot . Hyde withdraws it , allowing Poole to slam the door closed . Then with an inarticulate growl , Hyde looks about him for something . WE PAN DOWN AND UP with him , as with superhuman strength , he wrenches a foot scraper embedded in the brick stoop . He is just about to use it to jimmy open the door between the handle and the jamb , when he does a `` double take '' and looks o.s . 231 LONG SHOT - BOBBIE - HYDE 'S ANGLE 231 Far down at the corner , he is just emerging into view , strolling along the street at right angles to Hyde . He stops and leans against a light post , folding his arms for a rest . 232 BACK TO HYDE He realizes his plan is futile . He softly lowers the foot scraper , tiptoes o.s . 232 122 . 233 FULL PAN SHOT - HYDE 233 He scurries out from entrance to his house , and down the street away from the bobbie . DISSOLVE TO : 234 FULL SHOT - CHEAP COMMERCIAL SECTION - STREET 234 The street is empty . In the far background , across the street , we see the skulking figure of Hyde , looking in the various shops as he hurries along . 235 CLOSE PAN SHOT - HYDE 235 He seems to be searching for a certain shop , passing a butcher 's , a shoemaker 's , a wine shop , a plumbing shop , notion store , etc. , peering into each with a sort of desperation . Finally , o.s . ahead of him , he sees what he wants . His face lights up . He is just about to start for it , when he looks down the street o.s. , from where we hear the sound of trotting hooves . He ducks into a dark recess , watches . 236 PAN SHOT - HIS ANGLE - TWO MOUNTED BOBBIES 236 They trot down the street , looking this way and that . 237 BACK TO HYDE 237 He watches them o.s. , as the sound of their horses ' hooves disappears . Then WE DOLLY AND PAN HIM as he hurries a few paces down the black street until he comes opposite a store window which reads : `` Grundy & Co. Stationery Supplies '' . He peers in the window . 238 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 'S ANGLE - STATIONERY , INK AND PENS . 238 They are on display . 239 BACK TO HYDE 239 He tries the door of the shop ; of course , it is n't open . He looks about , sees a newspaper rack - a heavy wooden standard seizes it , raises it above his head and smashes the window with it . He reaches in and snags paper , ink bottle , pen . Envelopes and paper scatter over the walk . Almost immediately , a light goes on in back of the store as a door opens and a man and his wife and an older woman rush into the front part of store . Hyde is now scooting up the sidewalk toward the b.g . The store folk come out , in nightclothes , viewing the wreckage , spying Hyde darting up the street . OLD WOMAN ( screaming ) There he goes - !

Hobson , the butler , appears coming from the b.g. , wearing top coat and carrying his bowler . HOBSON ( conscious of last people leaving in foyer , in a low voice ) I talked to Poole . Dr. Jekyll left the house at seven to come here . He 's very worried , sir . BEATRIX ( to Sir Charles ) There - you see , Father ? There must be something more than what you SIR CHARLES ( looking at Beatrix , directly ) That is all , Hobson . Thank you . HOBSON ( exiting o.s . ) Yes , sir . WE DOLLY INTO GROUP as Hobson leaves .

I could fetch him whatever he wishes , sir . DR. LANYON No ...

LANYON 'S HOUSE 246 He is just about to turn into the walk leading up to the front door when Hyde jumps out from behind the shadow of a bush . Lanyon steps back , startled . He holds vial case under his cloak . HYDE ( impatiently ) Well , well - have you got it ? DR. LANYON ( gripping his stick ) I beg your pardon . What were you doing hiding behind that HYDE ( in feeble grin of explanation ) Just - just waiting for you , Dr. Lanyon . I 'm the man from Dr. Jekyll the package ( then more like a dope fiend ) Where is it ? I 'll take it now . DR. LANYON Step into the house for a moment , please . HYDE No , no - there is n't time - there - ! DR. LANYON ( rather severely ) As Jekyll 's friend , I have the right to ask you a few questions . Come , sir ! He starts on up the walk .

LANYON Are you an acquaintance of Jekyll ? HYDE Of course . I 'm a friend - an old friend . ( reaching out his hand , his voice rising ) But if you even pretend to be his friend you 'll forego your asinine amenities and let me have that before DR. LANYON Where is Dr. Jekyll ? HYDE ( getting more and more impatient ) Oh , do n't worry - he 's alive - he DR. LANYON What 's the matter ? Is he ill ? Is HYDE He 'll be perfectly all right , I tell you ! DR.

HYDE ( as he does so ; with a snarl ) You pretentious fool - ! But his expression changes as Lanyon whips a revolver out of the drawer and covers him . DR. LANYON ( evenly ) I warn you , Hyde . If you make one step toward the door I 'll shoot you right between the eyes . HYDE ( getting a trapped feeling ) Now wait a moment , Lanyon - I can't let you come with me - and I can't tell you any more than I 've already DR. LANYON Why not ?

HYDE Once more - will you let me take this glass and leave ? DR. LANYON ( tense , still with revolver ) No . This will be seen through to the end . HYDE You 'd better think again , Lanyon . Do you want to live on as you have ... lulled in your blissful cocoon of ignorance ? Or do you want that safe peace of mind - your reason even blasted by a sight that would shock the lowest fiend in the Inferno ? DR. LANYON ( getting an awful feeling , but game ) You ca n't persuade me with all that mad babbling ! Whatever you 're going to do - get on with it ! HYDE Very well , Lanyon . But remember your vows to your profession . You 'll see a secret you are sworn not to reveal ... you who have sneered at the powers of science - you who have laughed at man 's ability to dissect his own soul ! Watch this , you pompous ass ! Watch this ! 248 HE HOLDS THE GLASS HIGH ... 248 ... then drains it . Immediately he goes into his gasping contortions , falls back into a chair . As the metamorphosis from Hyde to Jekyll takes place , Lanyon watches it in horror .

JEKYLL ( he looks up slowly , in a dull voice ) I 'll have to give her up , of course ...

I must He stops as he realizes that Lanyon is looking at him with a mixture of unrolenting condemnation and pity . He realizes he is up against the inovitable .

His pace slackens as he turns in through the grilled iron gate as WE PAN and he walks toward the front door in the b.g . 264 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - EXT . FRONT DOOR 264 He can hardly bring himself to pull the bell plunger . Suddenly he is aware of the dim sound of a piano o.s . He realizes that Beatrix is playing . WE PAN HIM as he walks down the front of the house to the end of the `` side '' garden . 265 FULL SHOT - FORMAL SIDE GARDEN 265 Jekyll comes around the corner of the house and walks across a small flagged veranda which leads from French windows of the drawing room to the flower garden . The garden centers about a small fountain and is set off with flower-bed patterns and marble benches . 266 266 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - EXT . FRENCH DOORS 266 He peers through them in the b.g .

She falters in her playing for a second . Jekyll puts his finger to his lips . She continues playing and finishes her piece very softly , watching Sir Charles over her shoulder , who by now is quite asleep . Then she gets up and hurries as quickly as possible without making any noise to the French doors , opens them , and comes out to Jekyll , closing the doors quietly . BEATRIX ( seeing his strained look ) Harry - dearest JEKYLL ( nodding toward garden ) Will you come out - where we can talk ?

You love me - I wo n't let you go . JEKYLL ( his voice rising ) That 's why I 'm giving you up ! Because I 'll love you till the end of time !

In the b.g. , Beatrix is sobbing on the ground . WE PAN Jekyll as he comes around the side of the house and stops . O.s . he hears her sobbing , faintly . He is terribly tempted to go back . He half turns and looks . He can not stand the sight of what he sees . He leans in weary torture against the side of the house , closing his eyes . Suddenly a look of horror comes over his face . He looks down at his hands . WE PAN DOWN to see his hand starting to change . WE PAN UP to Jekyll 's face . He looks down at his other hand . His throat starts to constrict , his face to change . JEKYLL ( wildly , looking up ) Oh - no - no - do n't let me - save me - do n't let me - ! But the metamorphosis is well on its way . 271 CLOSE SHOT - BEATRIX She still lies on the ground , sobbing . Then , Jekyll 's feet and legs appear slowly in the SCENE . They stand right next to her . She is aware of them . With a little sob , she half rises , reaches out and enfolds the legs , pressing her cheek against the knees . BEATRIX ( murmuring ) Oh , you did come back ... Oh , my darling .... For answer there is an ugly chuckle o.s . Hyde 's hands come down into the frame and clutch her arms . Beatrix in puzzlement , and then in dawning horror reacts to the chuckle and the hands . In almost the same moment , Hyde lifts her up and she is face to face with him . For a second , she is frozen with fright , then screams as Hyde 's face bends towards hers . BEATRIX ( after her scream ) Father ! Father .. ! Hyde laughs wildly and starts to struggle with Beatrix . 271 141 . 272 FULL PAN SHOT - SIR CHARLES 272 He is coming out of the drawing room on a dead run . WE PAN HIM over to Beatrix and Hyde . Hyde drops Beatrix who faints and slips to the ground . Sir Charles makes a gallant lunge at Hyde , but Hyde sends him reeling against the wall . Then with a wild animal laugh he leaps for his hat and stick . Sir Charles , however , recovers in time to intercept his progress around the fountain . SIR CHARLES ( calling ) Help ! Hobson - call the police ! Help - ! Hyde raises his stick and lays it across Sir Charles ' head . Sir Charles stumbles back and falls to the ground . Hyde leaps on top of him like a panther , and bashes the stick against Sir Charles ' head three or four times in rapid succession . The stick breaks with a final sickening blow . In the b.g . Hobson and a footman come hurrying from the drawing room . FOOTMAN Here - what 's going on - ! They spy Hyde and come after him . Hyde gets up and WE PAN HIM the length of the garden on the run . Hobson kneels beside Sir Charles ' prostrate body as the footman gives chase after Hyde around the corner of the house . 273 FULL SHOT - FRONT GATE 273 Hyde comes running from the garden . He stops for a second and looks up the street . 274 EFFECT SHOT - JEKYLL 'S ANGLE 274 A constable comes around the corner on the run , dimly discernible under a gas light . 275 BACK TO HYDE He runs o.s . down the street in the opposite direction just as the footman appears and the constable comes running up . FOOTMAN ( pointing in direction of Hyde ) There he goes ! It 's the monster ! The constable runs o.s . after Hyde , blowing his whistle . 275 142 . 276 FULL SHOT - MEWS 276 Hyde comes tearing down in toward camera . In a second , the constable appears after him . Another man or two , passers-by at the far entrance , take up the chase . Hyde leaps over a fence . When the constable arrives at fence , he blows his whistle again . 277 FULL SHOT - ANOTHER CONSTABLE - AT CORNER 277 He reacts to distant whistle , runs for it o.s . 278 LONG SHOT - HYDE - ANOTHER STREET 278 He runs past camera into b.g . A small group of idlers are standing at the corner . They block his progress and he bowls through them , knocking a couple down . Ad lib yells of surprise and anger . 279 REVERSE SHOT - STREET 279 The two constables come in chase , followed by more people . 1ST CONSTABLE Stop that man ! 280 GROUP SHOT - AT CORNER 280 As constables come running up . 1ST MAN ( pointing ) That way , constable ! WE PAN AND PICK UP Hyde , his cape flying , leaping down the street in the b.g . The rest give chase . 281 FULL PAN SHOT - HYDE - JEKYLL 'S STREET 281 He comes flying along and darts up the walk to the house . O.s . comes the sound of the constable 's whistle . 282 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE - AT JEKYLL 'S FRONT DOOR 282 He runs up the steps , vaults the balustrade and hurls his body sidewise through the waiting-room window at the side of the door . 283 FULL SHOT - INT . WAITING-ROOM Hyde lands sprawling amidst the shattered glass . He scrambles up and leaps out into the foyer . 283 143 . 284 FULL SHOT - INT . FOYER - JEKYLL 'S HOUSE 284 Hyde enters . Poole comes in from past camera . POOLE ( recognizing Hyde ) Here , here - how did - ? But he gets no further as Hyde , with a roar , bowls him aside and ducks out the back door toward the lab . Poole hurries to the door , opens it . O.s . we hear crowd noises and whistles . 285 PAN EFFECT SHOT - HYDE 285 As he leaps across the bridge in the back courtyard to Jekyll 's laboratory . 286 FULL SHOT - INT . SMALL HALL - INT . LAB BUILDING 286 Hyde comes through door from courtyard , closes door , locks it . Then he goes to door of lab , opens it , ducks inside , and we hear him lock this door . 287 EXT . COURTYARD 287 Poole and the constables come running across the bridge . POOLE He 's gone into the laboratory ! WE PAN THEM to the first door . They find it locked . 1ST CONSTABLE ( putting shoulder to door ) Heave , Bill ! 288 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE - INT . LAB 288 He is frantically looking for various vials to mix the potion . He upsets and breaks things in his fury . DISSOLVE TO : 289 GROUP SHOT - EXT . GARDEN - SIR CHARLES ' HOME 289 A constable , the footman , Hobson and Lanyon are leaning over Sir Charles ' body . Lanyon is shaking his head woefully . The constable shows Lanyon half of a stick . 290 CLOSE SHOT - BROKEN STICK WITH ITS SILVER HEAD CONSTABLE 'S VOICE ( O.S . ) This is the weapon what done it , Doctor . 290 144 . 291 GROUP SHOT AGAIN 291 DR. LANYON ( taking stick , then after a second ) Yes ... I was afraid so . ( rising ) Come - I think I can take you to your man . DISSOLVE TO : 292 INT . LAB 292 Hyde is feverishly mixing the potion , having to make some of its ingredients not already prepared . O.s. , there is a crash of door bursting . Then hammering on the laboratory door . 293 FULL SHOT - INT . HALL OF LAB 293 The courtyard door is down . The constables and Poole are hammering at the door of the lab . 294 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE - INT . LAB 294 In his haste , he knocks over a large glass jar . It crashes . 295 BACK TO CONSTABLES AND POOLE - HALL 295 1ST CONSTABLE ( suddenly listening ) He 's in there ! Open up ! ( then , as just silence comes ) Come on , Bill ! Bill has run in with a crow-bar , and after two or three tries , they break the door down . 296 PAN SHOT - POOLE AND CONSTABLES - INT . LAB They come running down the stairs . As WE PAN WE PICK UP Jekyll who is just staggering to his feet from the floor . POOLE ( amazed ) Dr. Jekyll , sir ! That frightful maniac broke through the house and JEKYLL I know . He struck me over the head . ( indicating , to constable ) Quick , man ! He went out by the back ! ( CONTINUED ) 296 145 . 296 CONTINUED : 296 The constables hurry to the back door , o.s . POOLE I did n't even know you were home , sir . Are you badly hurt ? JEKYLL I 'll - I 'll be all right . The two constables come from the back door . 1ST CONSTABLE ( to Jekyll ) This here door 's locked . JEKYLL ( impatiently , pointing up stairs ) Then you better get round through the front ! The two constables leap up the stairs , just as Lanyon , another constable and an inspector in plain clothes come hurrying in . DR. LANYON ( looking at Jekyll below ) Wait ! 1ST CONSTABLE ( explaining ) He ducked through the back and locked the door after him ! DR. LANYON ( in great strain ) No , he did n't ! He 's still down here . They watch him , amazed , and follow down the steps to the lab proper . He approaches Jekyll . Jekyll looks at him , tired , wan . There are tears in Jekyll 's eyes as he waits for the word by Lanyon . Lanyon , too , is greatly affected . He seems as though he ca n't say the word . DR. LANYON ( finally gathers himself - pointing to Jekyll ) There - Heaven help him . POOLE ( shocked ) Dr. Lanyon - ! ( CONTINUED ) 146 . 296 CONTINUED : ( 2 ) 296 INSPECTOR ( Puzzled ) I know this gentleman . He 's Dr. Jekyll . DR. LANYON ( tears in his eyes now ) I know . Nevertheless , there 's your man . INSPECTOR You ca n't be serious , Dr. Lanyon . I DR. LANYON ( suddenly pointing ) Watch - ! For Jekyll has already started to turn back to Hyde again . They all watch him in awe and horror as he goes through the metamorphosis . 297 CLOSE SHOT - POOLE 297 He backs away slowly . 298 CLOSE SHOT - CONSTABLES AND INSPECTOR 298 Their jaws are dropping . 299 CLOSE SHOT - LANYON 299 He looks away . He can not stand it . 300 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 300 For he is now almost completely Hyde . He comes out of his writhings as such . He looks about at the others , as though he has just seen them for the first time . He is more bestial and awful in physique and manner than we have ever seen him in the transformation . With a sudden yell he throws a huge jar at the officers , and ducks around the table . ( NOTE : In the following ensuing struggle ad lib commands from the inspector should come at the proper time : `` Grab him - hold him - do n't let him get up those stairs - guard that door '' .... etc . ) Hyde practically wrecks the lab in eluding his pursuers . He knocks them this way and that . He leaps across tables up on shelves , pulling them down . He growls and snarls and laughs in glee every time he eludes them . 301 CLOSE SHOT - LANYON AND INSPECTOR 301 This during middle of fight . Lanyon sees the gun in the inspector 's hand . ( CONTINUED ) 147 . 301 CONTINUED : 301 DR. LANYON ( pleading ) Shoot him , inspector - shoot him ! That would be his wish ! INSPECTOR ( grimly ) Must take him if we can ! ( darting o.s . ) Hold him now ! 302 FULL SHOT - GROUP 302 The constables seem just about to have Hyde cornered , when with another wild leap , he gets to a set of surgical instruments , and pulls out a large knife . With another yell , he makes a leap for freedom , brandishing his weapon . As he gets by the large apparatus on the table , the inspector lets him have it with the revolver . Hyde wheels , drops across the table , shattering some of the apparatus . They start crowding around him in silent awe , Poole crying with audible sobs . POOLE ( like a plea ) Dr. Jekyll ... Dr. Jekyll ..... ! 303 CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 'S HEAD - PROFILE 303 There is a strange light on it . As if in answer to Poole's plea , the face starts slowly and mystically changing back to that of the handsome Jekyll - a face peaceful in death - as if in death - without struggle or torture - Jekyll was restored to himself for Eternity . WE PULL BACK SLOWLY for a tableau . DR. LANYON ( line to come ) FADE OUT : THE END"
2004;Do n't sit so far away . - Anything that creates a distance should be avoided . - Okay . And try not to frown . - I 'm sorry . Was I frowning ? - You have to relax . How can I be expected to open up if you 're not relaxed ? - Right . - Take a deep breath . Start again . As you can see , this piece of paper has been divided into squares . There are 287 of them . Your sex history will fit on this single page in a cryptic code . Do n't forget to mention that there 's no written key to the code . The interview subject will only be candid ... if he knows he 's speaking in the strictest confidence . Right . Okay . So , when were you born ? June 23 , 1894 . Are you single or married ? Married . - What is your race ? - Do n't waste time asking the obvious , Martin . - Fill it in yourself . - What is your religion ? - Methodist . - How often do you attend church ? Not at all now , but I did regularly until I was 19 . How did you get along with your father and mother when you were growing up ? That 's a multiple question . It allows me to ignore any part I do n't want to answer . - How did you get along with your mother ? - Fine . - We had a close relationship . - And your father ? How did you get along with your father ? And what are we to do ? We turn away from matters of the flesh ... and we turn to things ... of the spirit . Lust ... has a thousand avenues ... the dance hall , the ice cream parlor ... the tenement saloon ... the Turkish bath . Like the Hydra ... it grows new heads everywhere . Even the modern inventions of science ... are used to cultivate immorality . The gas engine ... has brought us the automobile joyride ... and an even more pernicious menace ... the roadside brothel . Electricity ... has made possible the degrading picture show . Because of the telephone ... a young woman ... can hear the voice of her suitor ... on the pillow , right next to her . And let 's not forget the most scandalous invention of all ... the talon-slide fastener ... otherwise known as the zipper ... which provides every man and boy speedy access ... to moral oblivion . Are you currently in good health ? I suppose so . Mm-hmm . What makes you doubtful ? Every doctor I 've ever seen . Early disease left me with a weakened heart . Did you have any illnesses that kept you out of school ? I had typhoid fever and rickets . Also rheumatic fever . Measles , chicken pox , pneumonia ... and several bouts of influenza . Pomeroy , what are you doing ? You 're worse than Martin . Never make judgments about people . I was n't . Your body posture told me that my list of ailments made you uncomfortable . Maybe it did . Sorry . Maintaining a nonjudgmental attitude ... is harder than you think . The best way is to smile , nod your head ... while looking me directly in the eye . Where were we ? Your health as a boy . It improved greatly when I finally discovered the outdoors . I never got over the excitement of setting off into the wild ... escaping bed , illness , family . Alone ? No . No . Never alone . I was surrounded by friends . Being in the outdoors taught me to rely on my own judgment . I started to learn about things by grasping them ... tasting them , looking at them . - Biology ? - Yes . Biology . The science oflife . The fields and woods became my new place of worship ... my cathedral . The only sadness they brought was when I had to leave them . How old were you when you first tried to pleasure yourself ? No . No . No euphemisms . If you 're talking to a college graduate ... use `` masturbation , '' '' testicles , '' `` penis '' ... '' vagina , '' `` vulva , '' '' urination , '' `` defecation . '' With the lower-level male , it 's `` jacking off , '' `` balls '' ... '' prick , '' `` cunt , '' `` piss , '' `` shit . '' I do n't know , Gebhard . Maybe your Harvard degree is too ivory tower for our purposes . I was brought up out west . I 've rubbed shoulders with ranchers , miners my whole life . - And I thought you were gon na shave that mustache . - I like it . It 's a disguise , a cover-up . Look at any movie . The villain's always the one with the mustache . My wife likes it . You have a chance to make an important contribution to knowledge and science . Are you telling me you 'd give that up for a little facial hair ? Yes , I suppose I am . Ah . Well , keep it trimmed . Let 's get back to masturbation . That 's a mating call . So , how 'd you wind up at the Stevens Institute , Al ? I thought you wanted to be a biologist . There are enough scientists in the worid , son . Engineers are what society needs now . I , um ... I had one of the old fits again . I tried to stop it . `` Any habit which causes the sex fluid to be discharged must be resisted . `` Doctors link it to an assortment of illnesses ... '' including insanity , blindness , epilepsy ... even death . '' What if it happens while you 're asleep ? `` It is said that the loss of one ounce of seminal fluid ... equals the loss of 40 ounces of blood . '' I 'm killing myself , and I 'm not even awake . What are we supposed to do ? `` Keep your bowels open ... '' read the Sermon on the Mount ... '' sit with your testicles submerged in a bowl of cold water ... Think of your mother 's pure love . '' Why do n't we pray . - Come on . Keep firing questions . - Come on . Keep firing questions . Extreme rapidity makes it very difficult for a subject to lie . How young were you the first time you had an orgasm while dreaming ? - How frequently did you have wet dreams ? - What did you dream about ? How young were you when you first experienced hugging or kissing ? - Necking ? - Petting ? - Oral sex ? How young were you when you no longer thought of your parents ' home as your own ? Al , it 's getting late . Let 's make the rounds . - Al. ! - Be right down ! Pack of Fatimas . Okay , son . That 'll be 15 cents . You 're a criminal , sir . I shall report you at once to the local authorities . DearJesus , a goddamn Protestant . - Did you not sell this vile weed to a minor ? - What business is that of yours ? It is the Lord 's work to protect the young from temptation . - Men like you , sir , men of weak character ... - Get the hell out of my store . - I 've given you proper warning . - Are offensive to right-thinking American citizens ... Shut up ! You know what you are , Father ? A prig . - Al . - A skinflint , a petty tyrant and a hypocrite to boot ! You think you matter ? You do n't matter . There 's something wrong with him . - Come on , Al . - No . Maybe your workload is too heavy . You could drop mechanical drawing . I 've withdrawn from Stevens . That 's impossible . I 'm a senior member of the faculty . Someone would 've informed me . Why ? Everyone there hates you . I 'm going to Bowdoin to study biology . And how do you intend to pay for that ? They 've given me a partial scholarship . And I 've socked away most of my scouting money . You 've become a shady person , Al ... a person who keeps secrets . I had no choice . What a disappointment you turned out to be . - How many years of schooling did you complete ? - Twenty . After taking my undergraduate degree at Bowdoin ... I received my doctorate from the Bussey Institute at Harvard . I took a position as assistant professor of zoology ... here at Indiana University . At first I studied the Rhaetulus didieri ... or stag beetle . Then I discovered a far more fascinating insect . This is the American Cynipidae , or gall wasp . Here the wasp deposits an egg ... into its host plant . In this case , an oak tree . The adult wasp chews its way through the tree ... and copulates . At which point it has the good sense to die . The animal kingdom includes ... at least two million insect species . So , what makes the gall wasp so fascinating ? I 've spent the last three years ... crisscrossing the continent , collecting gall wasps . And what have I learned from my tiny friends , half the size of the household ant ? That you need a date . Shh ! After studying thousands of these pesky creatures under the microscope ... I 've yet to find a single gall wasp that 's the same as another . In fact , some are so different ... that the offspring of one generation ... bear no more resemblance to their parents than a sheep bears to a goat . There are those of us who might take comfort in this fact . Consider the implications . If every single living thing is different from every other living thing ... then diversity becomes life 's one irreducible fact . Only variations are real . And to see them ... you simply have to open your eyes . Hello . Mind if I sit here ? Why ? Because you're the only unattached male ... and I 'm the only unattached female . That 's very sensible . A man who cooks . How refreshing . I picked it up when I went out west to collect galls . I was gone for 11 months , and I do n't think I saw more than a dozen people the whole time . - Sounds lonely . - Oh . I enjoyed it . I 've been reading up on gall wasps . - I think I know why they appeal to you . - Uh-huh . They have great big wings , but they ca n't fly . They are incapable of getting from this hill to that hill ... unless it 's close enough to walk ... which means it 's possible ... to retrace each generation 's steps , hill by hill ... by hill by hill ... all the way back to the very beginning . The gall wasp Garden of Eden . That 's very interesting , Miss Millen . You 've managed to bridge the gap between Darwin and the Book of Genesis in a single phrase . - McMillen . - Mmm ? - Clara McMillen . - Oh ! I 'm Prok . - Sorry ? - It 's a nickname my graduate students have given me . Pro ... fessor K ... insey . Prok . At first I worried that it suggested an inappropriate level of intimacy ... between teacher and student ... that could lead to a loss of respect down the line . I think it just means they like you . Yes . Eventually I realized that . Um , tomato bisque and sandwiches ? Please . Such an impressive collection . Thanks . They used to be categorized by period . But then I rearranged them alphabetically by composer . I find it 's more efficient . Did you ever think about playing professionally ? Because you 're very good . Oh , please . Thank you . But , uh , `` very good '' is n't good enough . I got you a present . - Ah ! - Here . Oh . Oh , how marvelous ! - They 're the right size . - Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! At what age did you first have premarital intercourse ? I did n't . - So , at the time of marriage you were a virgin ? - Yes . Was your spouse also a virgin ? Yes . When you got married , did you want to get married ? Very much . I see marriage as a lifetime partnership between equals . You 're a brilliant scholar with a keenly perceptive mind ... and a profound respect for nature . You 're a capable hiker and camper and a champion swimmer ... and you 're the one girl in a million who 's as interested in insects as I am . To be honest , Prok ... I 'm just not sure . Okay . - I consider myself a free thinker . - Yes ! Frankly , I find you a little `` churchy . '' `` Churchy '' ? And I 've had another proposal . I 'm not saying no . I just need time . Prok . I think you 're mean ! Mean , heartless and cold ! Astounding . If you 'll have me . A gall wasp in amber . - How old is it ? - About 80 million years or so . Does Mrs. Kinsey like her wedding present ? It 's perfect . - I 'm sorry . - No , no , I ... l ... How beautiful . May I ? I 'm sorry . I 'm a little nervous . It 's okay . W-We do n't have to ... No ! I 'm ready . - Forgive me , Mac . - No , I 'm sorry . It 's just ... It hurts too much . It 's ... It 's a long drive to my parents ' ! We should get some sleep . Robert 's had a 92 in mechanical drawing ... a 95 in mathematics ... and a clean 100 ... in shop practice . Huh . That 's splendid , Robert . Congratulations . I was worried that his teachers were showing him favor ... due to my senior position ... but they tell me he is the most gifted student in his class . Well , living with the best teacher at Stevens does n't hurt , Father . Oh , please . At this rate , he 'll finish his degree in , uh , three years . Al , tell us what you've been working on . - Well ... - Do n't bother , Al . She wo n't be able to follow you . She 's only had a fourth-grade education . I 'm studying gall wasps , Mom . I 've gathered over 100,000 specimens , which is really only a drop in the bucket . But my aim is ... Ten years ofhigher education , and he's still collecting bugs . Prok 's also written a biology textbook . Really ? It 's read in colleges across the country . It 's actually a very good read . So I assume you plan to start a family soon . No , no , I ... Do n't rush it . Once you have children , you're tied down forever ... your life is over . What ? I do n't know what I expected , exactly ... but he 's far worse than I ever imagined . He is pretty awful , is n't he ? - `` I once read ... - Shh ! `` That the decline of the Roman empire ... was the result of too-frequent bathing . '' Shh ! Shh ! Shh . `` Some speculate ... '' that rampant adultery ... is a possible cause of earthquakes . '' I 'm sorry you had to witness that . I think I really fell in love with you tonight . Seeing you here . Do you think we can make this work , Mac ? I do n't know . I 've ... I 've heard some people ... just do n't fit together . There 's no one I 'd rather be with . Physically ? I mean ... If only there were some way to know . That 's it , Mac . Every problem has a solution ... even this one . We just need to talk to someone , an expert who 's studied the matter . What are you doing ? Why waste any more time ? Your hymen shows an inordinate thickness . Dr. Kinsey , how large is your penis ? Excuse me ? When erect , how large is it ? How long from the scrotum ? Here ? Here ? Here ? I 'm surprised you did n't pass out . Is there anything we can do ? It 's a common-enough problem . Would you like to take care of it today ? Sure . - Oh ! - God ! God . God . What was the maximum number of times you had intercourse with your spouse ... in any seven-day period ? I 'd say ... 20 or so . At least three times a day the first week , so 21 , at a minimum . Is there tongue kissing during foreplay ? - Yes . - Yes . - Hand on breast ? - Yes . - Mouth ? - Hand on female genitalia ? - Hand on penis ? - Yes . Mouth on female genitalia ? - Mouth on penis ? - Yes . - Yes . - Yes . - Yes . - Yes . Yes . Yes , yes , yes . I became pregnant with Anne in 1923 . I decided to give up my graduate work . By the time Anne was born , I had collected over 200,000 gall wasps . Joan came along a year later . Just afterJoan 's fifth birthday , I reached my goal of half a million wasps . And Bruce is our youngest . Bruce found the gall that hatched the millionth wasp . It was in the mountains outside Mexico City . They grow up so fast . Wejust did n't know who to talk to , Professor Kinsey . What about your parents ? I 'd rather die . We heard you had good advice for some of the biology students . Sexual difficulty among newly married people is more common than you think . It 's nothing to be ashamed of . - How long have you been married ? - Two months now . And , Emily , you 've had absolutely no response during that time ? It 's like I 'm dead down there . We went to the doctor , and he said there 's nothing wrong . Does Ben ever use his fingers to excite you ? Um ... why bother ... now that we can do the real thing ? What 's your most common sexual position ? There 's more than one ? Mac and I are still discovering some . Emily , were you sexually experienced before you got married ? No . I still thought babies came out of women 's navels . Did you ever masturbate ? It 's all my fault . I 'm damaged in some way . I 'm frigid . I do n't think that 's the problem at all . Ben , do you ever perform oral sex on Emily ? Uh , I ... I do n't know what that means , sir . Genital kissing . My brother told me that that causes problems ... later on ... with having babies . Oh , I do n't think that 's true . No , I heard that too . I can assure you , there 's no relation between oral sex and pregnancy . But how do you know ? How do I know the Earth is round ? It just is . But ... has anyone actually proven ... that there 's no connection ? If you 're asking whether there 's been a scientific study ... devoted to the subject of oral copulation and fertility ... well ... frankly , I do n't know . Well ... then how can you be sure ? I felt like a blundering amateur . I could n't imagine where those kids ' crazy idea came from ... until I discovered this ... Ideal Marriage : Its Physiology and Technique . Oh , dear . `` Oral contact , while acceptable as a means of stimulation ... is pathological if carried through to orgasm and possibly injurious . '' I must be in grave danger then . Wait . `` The hand should never be used for the purpose of sexual excitation . `` There is but one finger of love with which to approach the female genitals ... and that is the male organ . '' It 's all just hooey . Morality disguised as fact . - Just do your tie . - Hmm ? Oh . Professor Kinsey 's methods ... of collecting vast numbers of gall wasps ... over a wide geographic range ... have made him a starred scientist . They have also earned him his immortal nickname ... '' Get-A-Million '' Kinsey . `` Bore-A-Million '' Kinsey . His new book , The Origin of Higher Categories in ... '' Sinnips '' ? `` Cynips '' ? Close enough . Traces the origin of the gall wasp back to its birthplace ... in the Upper Cretaceous . So , now I give you ... Dr. Kinsey . Thank you , President Wells , for that incisive description of 20 years of work . I thought you might actually have read my book ... until I saw those crib notes in your palm . Crib notes ! Of course , my other book on cynips ... has n't been checked out of the library in six years . I 'd be surprised if a dozen people have read it . But I guess I always knew that gall wasps were n't going to ... make them beat a path to my door . In any case , thank you , Herman . This is ... This is splendid . A really fine event indeed . - Thank you . - Cheers , Prok . - Congratulations . - Hear. ! Hear. ! Cheers . Some reform-minded undergraduates ... paid me a visit the other day , Thurman . They are campaigning for a sex course . I already cover sex in the hygiene class . Which the student paper called the most useless course on campus . Oh , Kinsey . I 'm glad to see middle age has n't softened the edges . - Mrs. Kinsey . - Not only is your class irrelevant , it 's irresponsible . There 's a V.D . Epidemic sweeping this country , Thurman . And that 's my fault ? I do n't know whether to be insulted or flattered . Besides , there 's a cure for syphilis ... and it 's called abstinence . Penicillin works just as well . Herman , the trustees appointed you to shake things up around here . Why not address the need for sex instruction that deals frankly ... with students ' real questions , real concerns ? Open sex instruction promotes daydreaming . It is better to address these matters in a general medical course . You mean an anti-sex course ... with irrelevant gabble about dahlias and bees . Gentlemen . Please . I am going to take the students'proposal under advisement . Good . But since I just got this job ... and would n't mind hanging on to it for a couple of weeks ... I think I 'm gon na stick with the hygiene course for now . Medical authorities state ... that , of the type of teenage giris applying at public health stations for aid ... the percentage that is infected with venereal disease ... is always very high . In all of these cases ... where youthful energy and inquisitiveness are unrestrained ... The sex urge is always present ... and promiscuity nearly always follows ... - With its inevitable harvest ... of abortions , illegitimate births and ... disease . - What 's your trouble , Jerry ? - Well , I ... I 've got a pretty bad sore down here . Just stretch out on that table over there . We 'll have a look at you . The story vividly portrays ... the misery caused to innocent victims ... - By the ignorance or selfishness ... of individuals infected with syphilis . You had to learn the hard way ... that you ca n't tell by the looks of a woman whether she has syphilis or not . I guess that finishes me . I 'll have to quit school and go someplace where people do n't know who I am . The cure forjuvenile delinquency is ... an education in the dangers and consequences ... of breaking the time-tested rules ... laid down for the regulation of human conduct . The idea that men need sex ... is a lie . If it were true ... the boy who exercises his sex organs regularly ... would achieve the greatest sexual experiences in later life . Whereas , in fact , that boy is likely to be sexually dead ... by the time he reaches adulthood . Abstinence poses no difficulty ... for the college-age male . Men do n't reach their sexual peak until the age of 40 . It is the lower-class male ... often Negro ... who finds it difficult to control his urges . However , perfect inhibition ... although an ideal to be striven for ... is not always achievable . Stress and the worries of the day ... can lead to a weakening of resolve ... opening the door to temptation . When tense at bedtime ... I find there are little tricks to relaxing . If I ca n't get to sleep ... I like to close my eyes ... and think of all theJohns I know . Oh . Well , not onlyJohns . Sometimes Peters . How about Dicks ? I 'm sorry ? If you 're here to enroll in Dr. Kinsey 's class ... If you 're here to enroll in Dr. Kinsey 's class ... it 's only open to faculty members and their wives , graduate students ... seniors and married undergraduates . Come back and try in the spring . Are you a senior ? Um , we 're engaged . - Congratulations . - Thank you . Why offer a marriage course ? Because society has interfered ... with what should be a normal biological development ... causing a scandalous delay of sexual activity ... which leads to sexual difficulty in early marriage . In an uninhibited society , a 12-year-old would know most of the biology ... which I will have to give you in formal lectures . So , let 's start with the six stages of the coital sequence . Stimulation ... lubrication , erection ... increased sensitivity ... orgasm and nervous release . Both sexes experience all six stages equally . Stimulation . Who can tell me which part of the human body ... can enlarge a hundred times ? Um ... miss . I 'm sure I do n't know . And you 've no right to ask me such a question in a mixed class . I was referring to the pupil of your eye , young lady . And I think I should tell you you 're in for a terrible disappointment . It is often with the eye that stimulation begins . The actual adjustments which are made in the male and female genitalia ... are shown on this slide . The vagina must be spread open ... as the erect male organ penetrates . You will see that the clitoris is swollen ... thus providing the erotic stimulation necessary ... for the completion of the act on the part of the female . You will also see that this point on the penis ... which is one of the most sensitive points , is similarly stimulated . Ohh ! Where on earth did you get that cap ? Oh . Professor Kinsey . I 'm sorry . It 's a whaler 's hat . Not very pretty , but extremely practical in a storm . - Do I know you ? - I 'm in your marriage course . Clyde Martin . How are you finding it , Mr. Martin ? Oh , it 's the most enlightening class I 've ever taken . Well , I 'd better get going . I 've got a job interview at the zoology department . Forget that . Come with me . All right . Do n't worry . Dr. Kinsey will be staying late . He 'll get to all of you . Can too much sex cause cancer ? Will wearing high heels make me sterile ? I think my vagina 's abnormally shaped . Can you get syphilis from a whistle ? Is homosexuality a form of insanity ? I think about my cat . A lot ! Does su-s-s-suppressing sex ... lead to stuttering ? Is my penis smaller than most ? Does too much masturbation cause premature ejaculation ? Is it unusual for my boyfriend to touch my anus ? All excellent questions . They all have the same answer ... I do n't know . From a sexual standpoint , it 's hard to say what 's common or rare ... because we know so little about what people actually do . This leaves most of us feeling anxious or guilty . Am I interested in the right things ? Do I do things the normal way ? One of the ways of finding out what people do ... is to find out what they 've done . So please , take the time to fill out these sex questionnaires . Try to be as accurate and honest as you possibly can . This will only work ... Pass them along , please . This will only work if you tell the truth . Dr. Kinsey , this is really ... amazing . These colors are incredible . It 's the most complete collection east of the Mississippi . We have over 250 separate varieties of irises . Good work , Martin , but you 're using the wrong muscle group . Come on . Here . Bend the legs . Use the thighs . - Okay . - The arms should only be used to guide . No , you do it . Guide . Ah ! Lemonade . Mac , these responses will floor you . The gap between what we assume people do and what they actually do ... is enormous . You know what amazes me ? There 's no relation between how sexy a girl looks and her sex life . The ugly ones seem to get all the action . I always thought `` ugly '' was an ugly word . Sorry . Not only does every male in the class have a history of masturbation . Most of the women do too . That does n't surprise me . What about premarital sex ? About a third of the married men claim at least one experience . - It 's only one in 10 for the women . - If they 're telling the truth . And there 's extramarital sex too . Not just heterosexual , but homosexual . I just wish we could get more volunteers . A hundred cases is hardly representative . Maybe it 's because it 's a questionnaire . Feels too much like homework or a test . I agree . Also , people do n't know if they can trust you . - They have to be sure their secrets are safe . - But that 's ridiculous . Everyone knows I keep those questionnaires under lock and key . Clyde has a point . You 're asking people to reveal information that 's very sensitive ... possibly even damaging . What if you just talked to them ? Then all their secrets would be in your head . Martin , you should have spoken up months ago . I ca n't tell . Was that a compliment ? Yes , I think it was . People resist at first . But I 'm trying to choreograph the questions ... so they 'll be disarmed into answering . - How many different things have you put in there , Daddy ? - It 's the Kinsey stew , sweetie . `` Clean out the refrigerator '' night , you mean . Martin 's been surprisingly helpful . He 's an ideal practice subject , since he's had relations with both men and women . - Where have you been ? - Swim practice . - How 'd it go ? - Pretty good . - Coach said he might start me at the next meet . - Bruce , that 's wonderful . I told you there wo n't be any more swimming unless your science grades improve . I ca n't help it , Dad . I hate biology . That 's because you have never developed your intellect . Physical activity is important , Son ... but your interest in sports is excessive . Yes . Maybe he should take up engineering instead . The one-on-one is turning out to be so elastic . Talking to people yields more information than I ever imagined . I think it will prove to be a groundbreaking technique . What if they make things up ? That 's what I 'd do . I 'm building in little trip wires to catch lies and inconsistencies . - Would you like to take my sex history , Daddy ? - Do you have a sex history ? No . What about you , Anne ? You 've been dating Jim for a while now . We 've done some petting . I figured we wouldn't try intercourse until college . That 's probably better . If Anne can have intercourse , I should be able to too . Your sister 's 18 and seriously involved with someone . Does it hurt ? - What , dear ? - Breaking the hymen . Oh ... just a little ... it 's nothing too bad . It helps if you spread the vulva to facilitate penetration . Can we please talk about something else for once ? Other families do n't do this . It is n't normal . When did you become such a prig ? My friends are n't even allowed to come over here . Their parents think you 're a menace ! You spend too much time in the water . All that chlorine 's done something to your brain ! - Have you learned nothing ? - Sometimes I do n't know where he came from . Nothing ! Bruce ? Bruce . I do n't wan na talk about it . He wo n't get off my back . I heard about this community from a former student of mine . This is my third trip , and already the results have been astounding . By my calculation , there are over and no one 's ever even bothered to talk to them before . It 's a gold mine of information , Martin , and we 've got it all to ourselves . What 'll it be , handsome ? Two scotches . I find liquor is an essential tool for social lubrication ... although it has involved more drinking than I thought I would ever do in a lifetime . Let 's get started . Hello , I 'm Professor Kinsey from Indiana University ... and I 'm making a study of sex behavior . - Can we sit and talk ? - I assume you 're joking . No , I 'm not . I 'd be grateful if you 'd answer some questions about your sexual history . Mary here is a professor . She says she wants to study my sex behavior . Well , tell her to stick around and watch . - Andy 's here . You have to see what he 's wearing . - I ca n't wait . That Andy . Hello . I 'm Professor Kinsey from ... Excuse me . I 'm Professor Kinsey . Excuse me ... Hello . I 'm Professor Kinsey from Indiana University ... and I 'm making a study of sex behavior . - Can I ask you a few questions ? - I 've heard about you . - You 're the sex doctor , right ? - I guess I am . If you 'd be kind enough to talk to me , it would be of great help to science . Sure . What do you want to know ? Same boy . Tommy Potts . We were messin'around in a haystack ... you know , the way kids 'll do . Pop walked in ... found us , locked us in the barn . Called my brothers in . They , um ... They branded us . Took turns doin ' it . Then they beat us raw . Broke a couple ribs , collarbone . Tommy , he , uh ... he did n't make out as well as I did . - What age were you ? - Thirteen . - And you 've been on your own since then ? - I get by . It 's not that I mind being queer . 'Cause I do n't . It 's just , um ... I wish other folks were n't so put out by it . Homosexuality happens to be ... out of fashion in society now . That does n't mean it wo n't change someday . Right . But why did n't I see it before ? Human beings are just bigger , slightly more complicated gall wasps . All I have to do is collect more than anyone else ... and homosexuals are the perfect place to start . What ? I 'm sorry . I just had an image of some of our friends hearing you right now . As if the marriage course is n't bad enough . Now , Prok , promise me you 'll get at least four hours sleep before heading back . Of course . And let Clyde share in the driving . Prok ? Okay , Mac . I 'll sign off now . I love you . Love you too . You know what impressed me tonight ? Mmm ? The way that you talk to people . You can get just about anybody to open up . Oh , well , it 's just a matter of , uh ... putting yourself on their level . No , it 's more than that . You really seem to care . - This rating scale of yours ? - Mm-hmm ? Uh , zero to six ... Zero being exclusively heterosexual ... and , uh , six being exclusively homosexual . A great many people line up somewhere in the middle . - What makes you think that 's true ? - Common sense . Remember , about a third of our heterosexual histories ... have homosexual acts , and vice versa . Right . I guess I 'm about a three , huh ? Based on your sexual history ... I 'd say that 's , um , right . How about you ? I suppose I 've been a one or two ... most of my life ... even though it 's taken a long time ... to recognize it . And now ? Probably ... th-three . Have you ever done anything about it ? Would you like to ? I 've taken on so many other people 's secrets . I do n't want any of my own ... and certainly not with you . You still have n't said anything . It 's not like I 'm ... surprised exactly . I 've observed ... certain things over the years . Such as ? A look or a gesture . The pet student who suddenly becomes a member of the family ... and then just as suddenly disappears when you tire ofhim . I think you must know me better than I know myself . But I 'm not sure ... I understand . Have n't I always been open to whatever you wanted ? It 's not you , Mac . You 're the best partner any man could have . I 'm just not enough . Is that it ? Please , Mac . This is inside of me . To what extent , I do n't know . But I 'd be a hypocrite if I pretended it was n't there . - When I took your history ... - Do n't ! Do n't ! - Did n't you admit to having sexual feelings for other men ? - Do n't use that against me ! I 'm sorry . But what keeps you from acting on your feelings ? Convention . No ! It 's our marriage ! It 's our children ! Exactly . Social restraints . Did you ever stop to think that perhaps those restraints are there ... to keep people from hurting each other ? I do n't sleep with other men because I love you ... and I do n't want to hurt you . But what if it did n't hurt me ? Then I 'd be hurt . You 're just afraid that I wo n't love you anymore , which is impossible , Mac . The human animal is capable of all kinds of sexual expression . Not all sex has to be sanctioned by love , enriched by emotion . - To the Greeks ... - Stop ! Stop lecturing , Prok . Stop using science to justify what you 've done . Oh , Mac . Mac . Listen to me . You 're my girl . You always will be . The bond we have , the life we share ... sex is nothing compared to that . I ca n't talk about this anymore . Most people think that what they do sexually ... is what everyone does ... or should do . But I might remark that nearly all the so-called sexual perversions ... fall within the range ofbiologic normality . For example , masturbation ... mouth-genital contacts and homosexual acts ... are common among most mammals ... including humans . Society might condemn such practices on moral grounds . However , it 's ludicrous to call them unnatural . But based on the first Book of Genesis ... and according to public opinion ... there 's only one correct sexual equation ... man plus woman equals baby . Everything else is vice . But the orgasm record of the males in this classroom alone ... proves the ineffectiveness of social restrictions ... and the imperativeness of the biologic demand . Why are some cows highly sexed ... while others just stand there ? Why do some men need 30 orgasms a week ... and others almost none ? Because everyone is different . The problem is , most people want to be the same . They find it easier to simply ignore ... this fundamental aspect of the human condition . They 're so eager to be part of the group ... that they 'll betray their own nature to get there . If something pleasurable and strongly desired is prohibited ... it becomes an obsession . Think about this . You have better things to do ... than help a middle-aged woman home with her groceries . Prok got worried when he could n't reach you . Said he had to take histories later this evening ... so he 'd like an early dinner . - Hmph . - Preferably 5:00 . Hardly gives me time to boil an egg . - Can I help ? - No . I 'll manage . I just ... I 'm sorry he made you play messenger . No . I volunteered . Mmm . Hear that ? - What ? - The sound of an empty nest . Must be a big adjustment . Have you heard from Bruce yet ? No . He 's loving college . Maybe it 's just being away from here . - Oh . - Would you like a piece of pie ? - Rhubarb ? - Have a seat . You know , Clyde , I did n't like you very much at first . I do n't blame you . - Most women would have had me murdered . - Oh , I considered it . I hate to think of myself as conventional . But if this had to happen ... I 'm glad it was you . And I ... have to admit there have been some benefits . It certainly sparked things up sexually . I suppose we 'd both grown bored without even realizing it . I think you 've handled it remarkably well . I learned something a long time ago . Once Prok has his mind set , it 's no use trying to stop him . Yes . He is ... relentless . Clyde ? You know , this thing between Prok and me ... it was fine for a while , but ... I guess I just really miss sleeping with women . That 's perfectly understandable . It 's clear from your history , you have a greater sexual interest in women than men . Good . Then you wo n't mind if I ask Mac to have sex with me ? I mean , only if it appeals to you , of course . - Would it be separately or together ? - Oh , definitely just you and I. Oh , I think I might like that . What do you think , Prok ? Mac . The Rockefeller Foundation is coming today . You-You know , I enjoy this ... tremendously . We still have to catalog those prints , Martin . - Please . - Coming , Prok . - Please . - Coming , Prok . - It 's just ... It 's a very full day . - Mm-hmm . Coming ! One key to understanding a foreign culture is its pornography . Every culture produces its own peculiar sexual imagery ... as distinct as its cuisine . As you can see , Brazil 's imagery tends towards zoophilia ... while Italy favors nuns and priests . In England , one often sees depictions of the stern headmistress ... wankers and spankers . While in the Far East , it 's soft `` flage '' and light bondage . You 've amassed an impressive collection . Thank you . Only what I 've been able to afford from my own savings . But if the Rockefeller Foundation agrees to our grant ... some of that money will help us build a worid-class library . Um , Herman ? That 's 200 years old . - Oh . - Have you any idea when you might decide ? Prok , please , Dr. Gregg just got here . Sometimes I 'm amazed anything has survived . The Library of Congress has a policy ... of destroying whatever it considers too erotic . The loss to science has been , uh , incalculable . There 's plenty of time to take your sex histories before dinner . Who 'd like to go first ? I ... I- I ... I do n't , uh ... Early in my bug-hunting days , someone asked me what I was looking for . I said I would n't know until I saw it statistically . A scientist can only generalize with reliable certainty ... if he has enough statistical information . Is this your first time in Bloomington , Dr. Gregg ? Yes . It 's lovely . Hillier than I expected . That 's why I 've broken the American population down ... into 200 major social subgroups . We 'll get anywhere from 400 to a thousand histories from each group ... for a total of 100,000 , give or take a few . It could take 20 years , but , at the end , we 'll finally be able to answer ... most of the basic questions about human sexuality . Herman , is the pot roast dry ? No . It 's delicious . The first publication will be a male volume ... followed a year later by the female study ... then another nine books dealing with sex offenders , homosexuality ... pregnancy and abortion and art ... studied from a sexual standpoint , of course . With the children gone , I do n't get to cook big meals anymore . Mac . Let 's get to the point . This project is one of the greatest ever undertaken ... in connection with the human animal . But without support from the Rockefeller Foundation , it will never get off the ground . There are those who argue that ... sex is largely a matter of feelings and psychological attitudes ... things beyond your training as a zoologist . That 's like saying a biochemist can't analyze cooking because he 's not a chef . - It 's inane . - Prok , come on . That is , it 's really a very stupid way of looking at things . One of the aims of science is to simplify . The only way to study sex with any scientific accuracy ... is to strip away everything but its physiological functions . And this team you 're proposing ? I 'll need two pair of hands at least ... both with advanced degrees in science . And Clyde Martin , of course . Since you 're working in such a delicate area ... they need to be as clean as Fuller Brush men . Um ... Door-to-door salesmen , Prok . I think what Dr. Gregg is saying is that anyone involved in the project ... needs to have motives that are entirely pure and scientific and above reproach morally . - I could n't agree more . - Ah . - Now , there 's one more thing . - Mm-hmm ? I hope you 're not planning to dwell on sexual oddities and perversions . Science is always interested in the rare . Yes , but it 's advisable to stick to what 's normal . You do n't want to shake people up . Of course not . I 'm just a taxonomist ... a measurer . I 'm happy to leave the social policies to others . Ah . Ah . Well , that all sounds good . Very good . So , if you 're ready ... I 'd like to begin with a few background questions . No . All wrong . Start by putting the subject at ease . No . All wrong . Start by putting the subject at ease . - Would you care for a drink , Mac ? - Why , a glass of water would be very nice . Do anything fun this weekend ? My daughters were in town , so I never stopped . We had a marvelous meal Saturday night . - Really ? What did you cook ? - I started with a little ... See how much more relaxed she 's become ? If you ease in with innocuous questions ... people forget they 're giving sex histories . How did you first find out about masturbation ? I invented it , son . Sometimes I tie a rope around my balls when I jerk off . - And what other masochistic acts do you enjoy ? - Does that mean `` queer '' ? How often do you have intercourse ? - Two or three times . - A month ? - No , a day . - Mmm . How often do you reach orgasm ? - Once . - A day ? No . Only once . About 20 years ago . I was sitting on a piano stool listening to music . Mm . Oh , that 's good . How old were you when you first engaged in sexual activity with a partner ? - Fourteen . - How ? With horse . How often were you having intercourse with animals at age 14 ? Is true . I fucked a pony . You are genius . How did you know ? You just said you had sex with a horse . No . Whores . Not horse . Whores . Do you find my answers typical ? - Am I normal ? - Am I normal ? Am I normal ? Yes . I found a book in the dining room buffet ... under all the tablecloths , and I used to put it under my shirt ... and go into the bathroom and sit and read it . But I was very frightened . - She told her mother that she did n't like it . - How will I get it back ? Or maybe it was just her mother who did n't like it . Before you know it , the police bangin ' on the front door . Hell , I did n't even know it was illegal . - Now I 'm in here for five years . - One of them old gals caught me out in the field . I guess I was about nine , 10 . And she say she was gon na show me a new game called `` puddin ' . '' And , well , I guess I kinda liked it . Horses in the stable , and by watching them ... The father said , `` I put my roll of bills in your mother 's pocketbook ... - and I got you for change . '' - But it felt good . - I saw myself as nasty and terrible ... - I believe in God ... I went to my mother ... '' Mama , is this true ? Do men put their thing in women ? '' I only did it that one time . If you were n't a virgin , you were a fallen woman . Nobody would want you . Tested us for , uh , masculine and feminine traits . - They were both naked . - It was part of me . You may kiss the bride . Did you hear Professor Kinsey found a place for us to live ? Oh , let me guess . It 's just a few blocks from here . - How did you know ? - He likes to keep the troops in one place . At least you passed the test . - What do you mean ? - Well , he took your sex history , did n't he ? Mm-hmm . Well , he would n't have let Clyde marry you unless you fit in . Uh , did n't Clyde mention the calendars ? Prok likes for us to keep a record of our sexual activity . - Tell them about that dream you had the other night . - Mmm ! I was in the middle of the most intense erotic encounter ... - He would n't say who with . - When all of a sudden the doors flew open ... and there was Prok standing there with that stern look of his . `` Gebhard , hurry up ! You 're wasting countless thousands of hours of project time . '' Well , needless to say , the mood was broken . So he woke up , and I had to take over . It was the quickest orgasm he ever had . We 're trying to get pregnant again ... so , uh , there was no raincoat to dull the sensation . Oh . Do the Kinseys know that you talk like this ? Uh ... - Could I get a picture ? - Um ... why do n't you call me when you get back from the honeymoon ? We 'll have a nice long lunch . - Look at the birdie . - Oh . No , I 've got the report . Thank you . Uh , often among boys who live in cities and towns , comma ... Less often among farm boys , period . Perhaps you wan na say '' boys from small towns '' ... - instead of '' farm boys . '' - Say-Say farm boys . Farm boys . What 's the difference ? He 's gon na rewrite it anyway . Henry . Everything looks in order here . You can have either Thanksgiving or Christmas off . Your choice entirely . Do you need anything before I go ? We 'll never get this book done if people start leaving early . I 'll stay if you let me help you with these . You do n't have the time to answer each one personally . If people take the trouble to write , it 's the least I can do . Mrs. Kinsey said to remind you to come home to eat . And your father phoned again . Do you want me to talk to him ? No . I 'll do it . For thine is the kingdom ... and the power and the glory forever . - Amen . - Amen . - Hello , Mildred . - Mr. Morrissey . Come say hello to Father . I 'm very sad for you , Alfred . Well , it 's not as though I 'll be alone . My daughter 's too fat to get a husband . And my son 's lost his business . He moved back home . The only one I got rid of is the big scientist . Now he 's working on some ... secret project . He was always the secretive type . Would you really like to know what I 'm working on , Father ? Oh , listen to this . He 's gon na tell me his big secret . It 's really not a secret at all . I 'm trying to find out what people do sexually . You heard right , Father . It 's a sex study . Well , what do you expect me to do , applaud ? No . But I would like you to contribute to the project . Oh . And you first moved to Hoboken at what age ? Sixteen . Could have done this interview without me , Al . I have n't told you a damn thing you did n't already know . Let 's move on then . - How young were you when you first masturbated ? - What ? - Touched yourself . - I never did that . The male without a history of masturbation is almost nonexistent . Well , he exists , Al , and you 're looking at him . This is n't gon na work . I do n't know why I bothered . Stay where you are . I 'll try again . How often did your masturbation occur in adolescence ? There was a problem , a ... A ch ... '' chronic condition , '' the doctors called it . How long did this continue ? I was outfitted ... with a tight strap that I had to wear at all times . It ... It kept me from coming into contact with my genitals . It was a ... a highly embarrassing remedy , but it-it proved effective . The condition was cured . How old were you ? I- I was 10 . I 'm so sorry , Dad . I 'm feeling a little tired now . Sounds to me like you're wasting your time , Al . Nobody wants to know about these things . How are you ? When can we see Dr. Kinsey ? - Hey . Hey , that 's him ! That 's Kinsey ! - There he is. ! My name is Dr. Thurman Rice ... and I 'd be happy to talk to you about Professor Kinsey 's ... - Over here. ! - Repugnant book . You are free to read and take notes ... but under no circumstances is the manuscript to leave the room . I wo n't deny the going might get a little rough . Dr. Kinsey 's findings are surprising , sometimes even shocking . For example , marital sex , which is really the only kind everyone agrees on ... is only one of nine means by which the American male achieves orgasm . Premarital sex , extramarital sex ... masturbation and homosexuality ... are much more prevalent than anyone has ever imagined before . I can assure you that Dr. Kinsey ... has done everything in his power ... to present this book tastefully . So , I thought this might be a good time ... to ask for a formal show of support . Those in favor . I just hope it 's not going to bring too much publicity . With any luck , Mrs. Spaulding ... the general public wo n't even notice . # According to the Kinsey Report # # Every average man you know # # Much prefers his lovey-dovey to court # # When the temperature is low # # But when the thermometer goes way up # # And the weather is sizzlin'hot # # Mr. Gob for his squab # - That 'll be `` sex-fifty '' please . - # A marine for his queen # # A G.I . For his cutie-pie is not # # 'Cause it 's too , too , too darn hot # # In an open society ... it is done through observation . But in a Puritan culture , sex remains a dirty secret ... often made dreadful through plain ignorance of what to do . Mark my words , as soon as the publicity dies down ... the American public will greet this book ... with the thundering silence it deserves . What brings you to New York , Dr. Kinsey ? We 'll be taking the sex histories or artists , writers and actors ... including the entire cast of A Streetcar Named Desire . We 'll also be interviewing women for our next book , which is a female study ... as well as meeting with our benefactors at the Rockefeller Foundation . Are you surprised at the success of your book ? No . It shows that the worid has wanted this done . Any plans on a Hollywood picture based on the book ? I ca n't think of anything more pointless . What about you , Mrs. Kinsey ? Has your life changed much ? My husband 's busier than ever . I hardly see him since he 's taken up sex . What about this female study , Mrs. Kinsey ? Gentlemen . Gentlemen , gentlemen . Please . If you want to write about something useful ... I suggest you look into the current sex offender codes . The majority of sex offenders in our prisons ... have nothing in their histories different from the rest of the population . Their only crime is being too poor to hire a lawyer . This is unfair . Everybody 's sin is nobody 's sin . And everybody 's crime is no crime at all . `` Everybody 's sin is nobody 's sin . '' That was n't my point at all . The newspapers lift things out of context to make sensational reading . Still , it 's hardly your place to offer moral prescriptions . You 're sounding more like a- a preacher than a scientist . My father always hoped I 'd become a preacher . And why do you insist on flaunting your association with the foundation ? Have n't I just given you the best-selling scientific volume ever published ? - Not only here but across the globe . - Yes . And it 's casting a bright light on every aspect of the project ... especially some of your latest methodology . Who have you been talking to ? - Well , I assume that most of it is gossip . - Alan . It 's been said that , uh ... you 've taken to observing women . - Go on . - In a heightened state of arousal . It 's true ? Yes . And do you know why ? We went to the leading gynecologists and asked for physical measurements ... and they barely knew what we were talking about . When it comes to female sex organs ... we 're all tragically ignorant . Who are these women ? - Volunteers . Friends of the project . - Prostitutes . No . Prostitutes are useless . They fake their orgasms . - Jesus ... - Alan . The sex histories we have are invaluable . Everyone knows true science lies in direct observation . Nothing can replace what the eye can see directly . - Or the camera . - Camera ? Do n't tell me . Y- You 're making movies ? Just some photographic studies of mammalian behavior . Oh . Nature films . Animals . Yes , if you like . Gentlemen , you 're about to meet a truly rare creature . Even the most casual contact arouses a sexual response in her . In intercourse , her first orgasm occurs ... within two to five seconds after entry . - All set there , Barbara ? - I think so . Come on in . - Hello . - How do you do ? Did I mention that Barbara did n't have her first orgasm until she was 40 ? Notice how she gently strokes the inner lips and the clitoris . Eighty-four percent of our sample stimulate themselves in this way . What about the vagina ? For all but a small minority of women , the vaginal tube is a dead cavity ... practically devoid of nerve endings . As you can see , the introduction of the penis ... does nothing to relocate the source of stimulation ... even with as skillful a partner as Pomeroy . - That is you , is n't it ? - Last time I looked . For years , women have been told that a clitoral orgasm is immature , neurotic . So they 've struggled with great anxiety ... to relocate the orgasm in the vagina ... when , for many , it 's a biologic impossibility . According to the psychoanalysts , this woman is frigid . Good news , everyone . The Rockefeller Foundation announced its annual grants today . We 've received $ 40,000 for the next year ... the highest grant they 've ever bestowed on a scientific project . Well . And they 've agreed to underwrite a new corporation ... making us future employees of the Institute for Sex Research . - To Dr. Kinsey . - Hear ! Hear ! - And Mrs. Kinsey . - Hear ! Hear ! And to our husbands ... the Fuller Brush men of sex . Come here , my little prick nibbler . Oh . Come on . Everyone , enjoy yourselves . Ah . You do n't look happy . No , I am . Really . It 's just that Clyde is going to be away for so long this time . Ah . Well , do n't worry . I 'll keep an eye on him . A lot of good that will do . What are you trying to say , Mrs. Martin ? God , you 're pretty . - Drink up your grapejuice , gentlemen . We have gathered only 9,300 histories ... and we have the female volume to complete . Starting tomorrow , we need to triple our efforts . Well , it 's still tonight , and since my third leg keeps hittin'me in the face ... I think it 's time for a tumble . In the bonobo chimpanzee ... our nearest primate relation ... sex is the glue of social cohesion and peace . Cleared of notions like romantic love ... or religion or morality ... their society 's behavior hangs together ... as a coherent unit ofbiology and conditioning . Based on the experiences of females who have contributed to our histories ... we have observed a wide range of motivations for extramarital coitus . At times , it is a conscious or unconscious attempt to acquire social status . In other instances , it gives them a variety of experiences ... with new sexual partners who are sometimes superior to their marriage partner . There are occasions when it is done in retaliation ... for the partner's extramarital activity ... or for some sort of nonsexual mistreatment . Some females discover new sources of emotional satisfaction ... while others find it impossible to share such an intimate relationship ... with more than one partner . We have also encountered a considerable group of cases ... in which husbands encourage their wives to engage in extramarital activities ... in an honest attempt to give them the opportunity ... for additional sexual satisfaction . I 've corresponded with this man for over 10 years , Pomeroy ... but I never thought he 'd agree to meet . He 's amassed a lifetime of data . Working for the Forestry Department has involved a lot of traveling ... so I 've met a wide array of people . - By the way , my name is ... - Please . There 's no need . Kenneth Braun . Do n't worry , Dr. Kinsey . I trust you . We 're actually a lot alike , you know . - How so ? - I record everything too ... the depth of every vagina I 've encountered ... the length and circumference of every penis ... the time to reach orgasm ... the distance of ejaculation . I 've written it all down . This is the record of my ... my life 's real work ... which is sex , by the way . Um , I find that recording is a ... is a way to experience things a second time , do n't you ? I also have certain ... rare abilities . From a completely flaccid start ... I can become erect and ejaculate in 10 seconds flat . I 'd say that 's pretty much physiologically impossible . Why , the rush ofblood alone would ... Oh ! Oh ! Shall we get started ? My grandmother introduced me to sexual intercourse when I was 10 . My first homosexual act was , uh , with my father . Uh , I was 11 ... Of the 33 members of my extended family ... I 've had sex with 17 of them . That 's five generations now . My penis is 8.24 inches long ... with a diameter of 2.8 inches when fully erect . In my youth , I averaged eight cubic centimeters of semen per ejaculation . By the time I was 50 , I was down to five . I 've had sex with 22 separate species of animals . I 've had intercourse with 9,412 people . I 've had sexual relations with ... Have you ever seen a boy orgasm ? No . No , right . I guess that 's why I 'm such a catch . Physiologically , it 's almost identical to an adult orgasm . Screw this . I 'll see you down at the bar . I thought you trained them to be impartial . Sometimes it 's difficult . Yeah , well , I suppose someone like me ... really puts your beliefs to the test , huh ? - How ? - You know . - Everybody should do what they want . - I 've never said that . No one should be forced to do anything against their will . No one should ever be hurt . You know , you 're a lot more square than I thought you 'd be . Let 's get on with it . Sure . Please , Governor . You 're so angry , I ca n't reason with you . When you calm down , we 'll discuss it . Seems that the archbishop of Fort Wayne ... tipped off the customs board . What is it with these people ? They 're simply depictions of man in his natural state . I do n't know much about natural states , Prok ... but here in the state of Indiana we have a problem . We 'll just have to take the customs office to court . And who 's gon na pay for that , the Rockefeller Foundation ? You 're an inch away from losing your grant as it is . That 's not true . What do you mean ? Hoover is still annoyed that you wo n't help him ... find homosexuals in the State Department . It is rumored that he is compiling dossiers ... on you ... the activities of your staff . And , as you well know , there have been complaints about your statistical methods . Trumped-up nonsense . Nothing but disguised prudery . Prok . Maybe there were small mistakes made in the male study ... but we 've corrected them in the female volume . This will be a very great book , Herman . - Much better than the first . - Let 's hope so . Liberty and license are as far apart ... As liberty and tyranny . Kinsey is a deranged Nebuchadnezzar ... leading women out into the fields ... to mingle with the cattle . `` Self-appointed messiah of the sexually despised . `` Having had his way with the male of the species ... Kinsey now insecticizes American womanhood . '' Did you get any sleep at all last night ? How many years do I have to study human behavior ... before I 'm no longer an entomologist ? - Why do you read them , Prok ? - I 'm trying to find out why people hate this book so . You told them their grandmothers and their daughters are masturbating ... having premarital sex , sex with each other . - What did you expect ? - Some respect ! Do n't answer it . - Hello . - Say , Kinsey , what kind of sick man are you ? Why do you wan na go around poking your nose ... We 're in trouble . The cost of film stock is astronomical . Should n't our nonprofit status get us a discount ? Prok , you 've got to let some of this go . We need a full-time accountant . What in heavens ... Stop this ! Stop it at once ! In my office . Gebhard , get in there . Everyone , back to work . Do you have any idea what a delicate time this is ? Our enemies are watching everything we do . We ca n't afford a single slip-up . This has nothing to do with the project . - Everything is about the project ! - Oh , it 's just a ... - a misunderstanding . - No , it 's not. ! You let things get out ofhand with Martin 's wife ... and now she wants to leave him . Is n't that right , Martin ? And what about you , Gebhard ? Are you planning to leave Agnes and the kids ? - No , of course not . - Then end it . - I 've tried . - It 's not difficult . Just tell her it 's over . - No explanation necessary . - All right . Clyde , I 'm ... I 'm very sorry about all of this . I saw this coming . Gebhard should have nipped it in the bud . You are so full of shit ! What are we to you , Prok ? We'rejust lab rats ? Is this just another part of the project ... To prove that sex ... No . No , I 'm sorry . Fucking is ... nothing more than ... than friction and harmless fun ? Well , let me tell you ... that is a risky game , because fucking is n't just something . It 's the whole thing . And if you 're not careful ... it will cut you wide open . Go home to your wife , Clyde . She 's going to need you . I thought the rules were clear . No intense romantic entanglements . They only make people 's lives unstable . I guess we all ca n't be as disciplined as you , Prok . The question of marital infidelity ... The question of marital infidelity ... remains one of the most complicated issues facing our society today . Reconciliation of the married individual 's desire ... for a variety of sexual partners ... and the maintenance of a stable marriage ... presents a problem which has not been satisfactorily resolved in our culture . The fact is , America is awash in sexual activity ... - only a small portion of which is sanctioned by society . Sexual morality needs to be reformed ... and science will show the way . Sometimes ... I sometimes wonder what this country would look like if ... the Puritans had stayed at home . What if all the rogues and libertines ... had crossed the Atlantic instead ? But the enforcers of chastity are massing once again ... to dissuade the scientist , intimidate him ... convince him to ... cease research . For heaven 's sake ! - If you could get him ... - Yes , Mrs. Kinsey . Mac . He 's killing himself . And you have to help me stop him . - Okay . - Hmm ? Hi . Doctors say my heart ... sounds like a cement mixer . At least they found one . Seems I 've developed a dependency on barbiturates . So ... if I 've been a bit harsh lately ... - How 's Alice ? - She 's fine . We 're fine . You should get some sleep . It 's always been my biggest fear , Clyde ... dying before I finish this work . In the course of these hearings on tax-exempt foundations ... we intend to show how Communists are financed in the United States . There is a diabolical conspiracy back of all this ... and its aim is the furtherance of socialism in America . Do you agree that Kinsey 's research ... aids the communistic aim ... of weakening and destroying the youth of our country ? I do not agree , sir . Well , tell me , Dr. Gregg ... does the Rockefeller Foundation really believe ... that it belongs in the business of sex research ? I think it 's probably something ... the foundation shouldn't have anything to do with . Dr. Kinsey 's project is now in a position ... to obtain support from ... other sources . With the loss of support from the Rockefeller Foundation ... Dr. Kinsey 's project will need other funding if it is to survive . Prok ? Prok , you home ? We are running a budget surplus due to increased enrollment ... which is a direct result of Dr. Kinsey 's success and fame . A small amount of this money ... would be enough to keep the project afloat . Prok ? - Prok ? - Why do n't we put it to a vote ? All those in favor of increasing Dr. Kinsey 's grant ? That 's it then . This woman was beaten by her father when she first menstruated . Now she 's incapable of physical intimacy of any kind . And this man ... '' Dear Dr. Kinsey ... '' it has taken me a long time to write to you ... I suppose because I was too ashamed and I ... '' Where 'd that blood come from ? I punctured my foreskin . I ... I wanted to understand different ... different kinds of sensations . It , uh ... It did n't give me any pleasure . And there ... And there was only a little ... pain . I could n't help them , Mac . I could n't figure it out . Just stop punishing yourself . Now I ... I 've ruined it for everyone . This is an exercise in futility . Huntington Hartford is heir to the A & P fortune . He can solve your financial problems with the stroke of a pen . I wo n't beg , Mac . I wo n't beg . Ohio deplores fellatio but tolerates cunnilingus . Whereas in my home state of Indiana ... all forms of oral sex are illegal , even within marriage . Mmm . The current sex laws are completely out of touch with the real worid . I 've had four wives . Some people say that makes me a sex offender . Well , Hunt , if you keep interrupting Dr. Kinsey ... you 're going to have to find a fifth . Please go on . Even now , 43 states will punish a single act of adulterous intercourse . I 'm thinking ofbuilding a museum . What 's your opinion of modern art , Dr. Kinsey ? It 's not my area of expertise , Mr. Hartford . - I really do n't consider myself qualified to discuss it . - Well , why not ? Just because I own some supermarkets ... that does n't mean I 'm only capable of talking about groceries . Oh . Do you hate modern art as much as I do ? Squiggly lines , empty canvases , white on white . So , the next book will deal with sex offenders ? We need money , Mrs. Hartford . We ... We need someone to give us money . You have no idea what I 've had to endure ... just to obtain the same rights other scientists take for granted . My funding has been slashed , and my name has been dragged through the mud ... in every newspaper and magazine across this country . Every dollar I 've ever earned has ... Leave me alone ! Every dollar I 've ever made has gone back into the project . But fighting this customs case has cost us an appalling amount . We 're broke . - Dr. Kinsey ... - Please . I 'm not even sure how much time I have left . Help me . I have to get it all on the record . Well , I 'm very sorry . Any support I give might be misconstrued as an endorsement of sex . I ca n't afford that kind of exposure . I see . But I 'm sure something will come through . You 're right . Rich people have lazy minds . Took them five minutes to find a water glass . - I 'm taking you to the hospital . - Mm-mm . Mm-mmm . No . No more beds . I spent my whole childhood lying in bed . Let 's go back to the hotel , Mac . I wan na pick up a few histories in the morning . We 'd been married for 23 years , with three marvelous children . And as soon as my youngest left to go to college ... I took a job in an arts foundation . I met a woman there ... secretary in the grants office . We became fast friends , and ... before long , I fell in love with her . Hmm . This came as quite a shock , as you might imagine . The more I tried to ignore it ... the more ... powerful it became . You have no idea ... what it 's like to have your own thoughts ... turn against you like that . I could n't talk to anyone about my situation ... so I found other ways to cope . Uh , I took up drinking . Eventually , my husband left me . Even my children fell away . I came very close to ... ending it all . It 's just another reminder of how little ... things have changed in our society . What are you talking about ? Things have gotten much better . Oh ? What happened ? Why , you did , of course . After I read your book , I realized ... how many other women were in the same situation . I mustered the courage to talk to my friend ... and she told me , to my great surprise ... that the feelings were mutual . We-We 've been together for three happy years now . You saved my life , sir . Just , uh , one more question . You'vejust told me your entire history ... childhood , family , career ... every person you 've ever had sex with ... but there has n't been a single mention of love . That 's because it 's impossible to measure love . And as you know , without measurements , there can be no science . But I 've been thinking a lot about the problem lately . Oh . Problem ? When it comes to love , we 're all in the dark . So , you do think it matters ? What time 's our flight , Mac ? Not for a couple of hours . Let 's stop in the woods . Mac ? I 'm right here , Prok . Just imagine ... these trees are over a thousand years old . Hence the name : Sequoia sempervirens ... always green , always alive . Mac , did I ever tell you about the Mbeere ? No , not that I recall . They 're an ancient East African tribe . They believe that trees are imperfect men ... eternally bemoaning their imprisonment ... the roots that keep them stuck in one place . But I 've never seen a discontented tree . Look at this one ... the way its roots are gripping the ground . I believe it really loves it . Come on , Mac . What 's the hurry ? There 's a lot of work to do .
1989;Scripts.com Fat Man and Little Boy By Bruce Robinson Page 1/55 At ease . Move it , move it , move it ! One , two , three . For he 's a jolly good fellow For he 's a jolly good fellow For he 's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny ! Hoorah ! Boy , those Japs better watch out for you , sir . Good luck . The Corps of Engineers is gon na miss you , sir . - Thank you , gentlemen . Bronson . - Sir . I built this place , so I 'll be glad to eat it . Well done , sir . You 're a lucky man . Give those Japs hell . Thank you , Thomas . Indeed , I will . Sir ! I 'm losing my chance to get out from behind a desk - and lead men in combat ! - Colonel Groves , forget it . This has ... Even Bronson wants to head for the front . Forget about the front . You 're an engineer . You 're gon na fight your war here . Is this what you 're assigning me to , this boondoggle ? Dead end ? This dead end , Groves , has the personal backing of the president . This is not what I was promised , not what I expected . Then bone up on it . Head to Chicago , talk to the scientist . If it looks possible , run with it . Take whoever you want . Have whatever you need . Just make it work . Who knows , you might just win this war on your own . Pick up a star on the way . Page 2/55 ... fighting for , and they are reported to be giving the Germans hell . Though these losses represent the most serious setbacks for the Allies in this war against the Nazi enemy . Bad news , too , from the war in the Pacific . We have just had confirmation of the sinking of three US cruisers . Names are being withheld . The casualties are high . Come in ! Reports of an early-morning raid by Japanese dive-bombers ... In here . In here ! - Szard ? - Szilard . General Groves , I was expecting you . Come in ! Come in ! Forgive me . Sometimes I get stuck in here . Metaphorically . I 've read this . - Is it possible ? - You could n't put a little more hot in , could you ? And I 'm not very good at fairy tales , so just give me the happy ending . What I wrote is possible , probably inevitable . Separate uranium 235 , then arrange for two portions of the element to be brought together suddenly , so that the resulting mass , no bigger than this , general , undergoes a spontaneous self-generating reaction . And if this was the epicenter of that explosion ... ... all of Chicago you could see from here would disintegrate . Hallelujah . Page 3/55 At the moment , all we have are theories , concepts , inspirations , - inconclusive results ... - Now , if we can make this device , - so can the Krauts . - Yes . Germany has the scientific capability . And , general , we need leadership here . - I can help ! - Thank you . You need an ally , general ! - So tell us about this general . - Why ? Because it 's so mysterious . '' Meet me in the middle of God-knows-where . '' Be there no earlier than 4:20 , no later than 4 : Well , word has it he 's a provincial windbag who 's spent most of his life digging holes in Latin America . - Graves for the natives , no doubt . - Oh , Frank . Seriously , Kitty , after all , Robert 's a scientist . If the Army wants him , they 'll want all of him . All of him ? Why not take all of him ? Look , I have to at least hear what he has to offer . - Robert , must we go so fast ? - Yes ! - It 's crazy . - Yes ! Yes ! This way , Dr. Oppenheimer . Doctor ! Up here ! Groves , Leslie . Friends call me Dick . Sit down . Ingenuity . Page 4/55 I love it . Created out of nothing but up here . Clear ! The old man likes his privacy , does n't he ? Guess what . - The egghead wants a carrot juice . - Get him what he wants , Bronson ! Get used to it . What an eight ball this guy is . Seems this Oppenheimer's a hot number . Says here , he 's got more damn brains than are decent . He knows it too . Temperamental . He ai n't gon na be an easy horse to corral . Oh , I think the general knows what he 's doing . Oppenheimer ai n't one of us . The general picks that guy , he 'll be making a mistake . It needs to get pulled together . So I think you 're the man for the job . And I got a weakness for good men . The Krauts are working on this , full bore . If they get it before we do , I do n't have to spell it out . Where would you start ? Focus . You have great minds , but all dancing to a different tune . You bring them together in one place , isolate them , no distractions . You create an atmosphere of creative stress . Everyone competing to solve one problem . And you have one ringmaster . Right now , it 's all over the place . You centralize everything . There is a hitch . There are people out there do n't like the color of your politics . Page 5/55 My politics ... ... are an open book . Well , I hope so . You could win a war and the Nobel Prize , God willing . Sir , Major de Silva wanted me to remind you you 've got a train to catch at 1800 hours . No rest for the wicked . Oh , doctor . If you take this on , I say this in all humility , intellect ... ... do n't outrank that . This general is a meatball , a cipher . He 'd be eating out of the palm of my hand in a week . So will you accept ? There are questions . There are a kaleidoscope of questions . I see . Well , I 'm a star at breakfast small talk . You 'll have to save some for evenings if you 're gon na be wife of the big cheese . Would this mean moving ? Oh , you have to say yes . You 're too brilliant for Berkeley . Michelangelo 's The Creation of Adam . Origin and destiny . Origins and destiny . The struggle to unearth the one and to discover the other . That is science ! And as I leave here to unravel my own small destiny , I congratulate each of you on being the best of the best . I have faith in you all . God keep you , and may your lives be rich and sweet . - Thank you . - We 'll miss you , Oppie ! Page 6/55 We 'll miss you , Oppie ! Good luck , Oppie ! Hurry up ! Move it , move it ! Let 's move that thing out back . Sir ! - Good afternoon , sir . - Give me the good news , Jack . We 've got utilities on throughout camp . We 've got the sewage problem taken care of . We have water throughout . - Got the two science buildings ... - Not good enough . We got ta be a couple of weeks behind . You know , I got a bunch of scientists up there . They 're just wandering , bumping into each other . Get some bodies in here . In a week , I wan na be two weeks ahead . I do n't think we have accommodations , sir . Why would they want accommodations ? You think they 'll sleep ? All right , get some tents , but put it on your EOR . Did n't I ask for dogs around that perimeter fence ? - Yes , sir . - I do n't see any . They 're coming , general . So ... ... whatever goes on around here is privileged information . No exceptions . No wives , no barbers . No exceptions ! What you see , what you hear , what you read , what you dream about , whatever ... ... gives you heartburn or feeds your Page 7/55 ulcers , whatever gives you the sweats , keeps you up at night , whatever , all of that ... ... belongs to the United States Army . Or to me , if that makes you feel more comfortable . Now , you got ta come down out of the clouds , gentlemen , and get into the business of winning a war . I 'm gon na say it once . I 'm only gon na say it once . Those of you who know , know . Those of you who do n't , do n't . You are not here to be comfortable . All right ? You are here to go beyond the theoretical , the speculative , the fanciful . You are here to harness your God-given talents , your minds , your energy , in the practical pursuit of one thing : A military weapon . Nuclear one . An atomic bomb . Keep the muttering to just a minimum , gentlemen . Why bother with a bomb ? Why not just drop that man on Berlin ? - When you talk about it ... - It will have the same effect . ... it will be referred to as `` the gadget '' or `` the device '' . Is that clear ? There is one word that I do n't wan na hear . And that 's the word `` impossible '' . - You 're two days late . - I went to 109 East Palace Street to report to Mrs. McKibben , but there was nobody there . So I hopped a construction bus , and it damn near drove me back to Chicago . Page 8/55 I 've been sitting on trains , buses , railway stations for 60 hours . I asked about this place in Santa Fe , and they said it did n't exist . It does n't . So where does a fellow get some chow around here , huh ? - We already ate . - Oh , great . Oh , if you wan na take a shower , I 'd take one now . They turn off the water at 2:00 . Keep those two men back there . We still got ta run the power through . Yeah , you two men there ! Higher ! A little more . All right , that 'll do it . Open this door , now ! Sorry . I could n't get in . Give it a month , you 'll do that because you ca n't get out . - You Merriman ? - Yeah . Richard Schoenfield . I 'm the doctor around here . You 're just what I 'm looking for in a roommate , a little brute strength . Holy shit ! - What in God 's name is this ? - It looks like a fridge . Oh , yeah , it does . It looks stuck . I guess you arrived just in time then . Thank God you 're here . Which end would you like ? Are you ready ? - You want me to get it myself ? - Lift . Oppie 's boys . No problem left unsolved . Gentlemen , this project has been separated into three areas . The physics . How much material do we need ? Page 9/55 Should it be plutonium or uranium 235 ? Second , manufacture of material , but that 's out of our hands . That 's Oak Ridge , Tennessee and Hanford . And third , our responsibility , and this is a cinch ... Yeah , sure . ... build the device , test it , and just hope that we can control it . Gentlemen , we are here ... ... at the beginning . Our objective is here . We have a deadline of 19 months . It seems such a short time . with our anticipated delivery date from Oak Ridge . Gentlemen , we have 19 months , that 's it ... ... to box , wrap and deliver this package . Are there any dissenters ? No ? Good . Nineteen months and starting from scratch , Jesus . Still , Oppie 's got the best theoreticians and engineers in the world . Some of these guys are legends and so young . The place is a hothouse . Doc , he seems like he 's gon na be a good man . Reckons we 'll be working with funny stuff . He 's gon na be looking out for us . He 's got a whole wing of the hospital that looks like Noah 's Ark . I think of Jimmy fighting in the Philippines , and I ca n't complain . I love you , but I got ta go . General wants a progress report . When Groves wants something , he wants it now . Again . We build a cannon , and at the end Page 10/55 weld a stopper made from a subcritical mass . We fabricate a shell made from another subcritical mass and fire it down the barrel . - How much of both materials ? - Projecting 30 pounds . as the moon . We 're trying to tap the energy that fuels the universe . It 's petrifying . All we 've got so far are problems , and that does n't include the ones we have n't thought about . Shake down the bad news . I 'm getting used to it . At the moment , there are two problems . Pre-detonation . The gadget disintegrates before it explodes . Second , it 's the weight problem . For the slug to travel at the velocity we need , the gun barrel would be so heavy , so thick , I do n't think we 'd get the gadget off the ground with a crane . If they 're talking about a slug with a seven-inch diameter , then you 'd have to have a barrel thickness of at least four inches . I hope you guys find the music . The way things are , we ca n't even hum the tune . Free discussion . Two groups ... - I 'm not comfortable with ... - Excuse me . Seth , Deke , the gun barrel . Robert , Michael , pre-detonation . Damn it ! Just , damn it ! Maybe it 's the altitude . But we 're still just chalk on a blackboard . Page 11/55 We 're dead in the water . Maybe we cast a lighter gun barrel , find a new alloy . The force would be too great . We got ta smack these atoms together to trigger a chain reaction . We got ta concentrate the energy and crush the mass . All right , let 's rethink this . We have a gun barrel that 's so heavy we ca n't lift it with a plane . To get the explosive power we need , it 's got ta be heavy . Michael , come here ! When I squeeze this ... - ... what do I get ? - Juice . No . I squeeze it , I get compression . We get a hollow sphere of plutonium , and we compress it with an explosion that goes in . - An implosion . - Chain reaction . Boom ! - But , Seth , explosives go out . - I know . But we make one that goes in . Jesus . - Michael . - Let 's get the boys . We 'll meet down here in the canteen . It 's brilliant . The device is gon na be so light that we do n't need a gun barrel ! Got a match , soldier ? Sir , it 's Michael and Seth ! I 'm sorry to bother you . But Seth had an idea . He was thinking of an orange . Yes , I was thinking of jumping up and down on an orange . - Crushing an orange . - Crushing ! Crushing ... the core . Page 12/55 Oh , God . This could be very sweet . - Where are the others ? - Canteen , they wan na kick it around . - Perhaps it can wait till later ? - No , you go ahead . - I 'd have lost you anyway . - Thank you . Goddamn it . Doctor ! - Come on ! - Double up , over here ! I 'm sorry . We were looking for testing sites and the bus got stuck . You had a meeting last night . You discussed the work in public . We were discussing Neddermeyer 's ... - In public ! - A table in the back of the canteen . - We were having a free discussion . - Let 's just talk about that . I do n't want free discussion . I want compartmentalization . I do n't want theoreticians knowing what engineers know . - Listen to me ... - It is a security problem ! These kids are used to pinning their best ideas on a board . Ideas are community property . It 's a matter of principle . You force my hand and there wo n't be any free discussion because there wo n't be anybody left to have it ! If you 'd been there you 'd understand . Neddermeyer 's idea was brilliant . An explosion that goes inwards , producing uniform compression in a core and it 'd be lightweight . No gun barrel , no velocity and weight problem . And all of that Page 13/55 out of free discussion . You 've got to give us room to breathe . - Bronson ? - Sir ? Just do n't give it to the waitresses . Oppie 's quite a match for the general . I 'm worried it 's not in Groves ' nature to rest until he gets the upper hand . We 're terrified the Germans are ahead . Working with restrictions and regulations is setting us on edge . This is typical . We are people , not numbers ! It 's not part of the agreement , general . I apologize for complaints , but barbed wire , dogs , guards ! - Security badges ! - Secrets ! I hoped to leave these things in Italy with Mussolini ! Openness is a principle matter for scientists ! And there are many other things . I resent my letters are being censored . The FBI talking to me , that 's one thing . But my wife , my family , that 's a little much . Do n't you think ? We can not continue work under these conditions ! - Doctor . - And what about ... ? Well , that is some monkey house in there . A mess . What are you gon na do about it ? I warned you about this . Look , you give me responsibility for security inside the lab . Page 14/55 We go where we like , as we like , when we like . Outside the lab , that 's yours . I will sell them on that . I do n't like it . But I will live with it , for now . The 8th Air Force today carried out its heaviest bombing of the war against Germany . Michael ! Michael . What do you say ? Good to see you . - How are you ? - I brought Kathleen with me . I was afraid this party would be a little short on the beauty side , so I took the appropriate precautions , if you know what I 'm saying . - I mean , she is my favorite nurse . - You two gon na get together ? No . No , we 're not . Actually , I 'm gon na get a drink . That 's what I 'm gon na get . A good stiff drink , that 's all I 'm gon na get . - Two bucks ... - It 's a short bet . - Like I said ... - This is stuck . ... it can be pretty lonely here . There 's a war on . Not everybody can go to Acapulco . - Oh , my . - Are you OK ? Good . Thank you . Look , they 're perfect . Another minute , they would have been overdone . Well , I 'll put this in the sink . - Would you like some orange juice ? - Yes , kindly . - I am sorry . - Oh , do n't worry about it . - This will be taken care of . - It 's OK . Page 15/55 Anyway , I 'm sure we 're going to be allies , general . We 're both trying to seduce the same man . So is there a Mrs. Groves ? Yes , there is . And she has the courage to stay in the background . Some men are on the planet for a purpose , Mrs. Oppenheimer . A good wife recognizes that and is happy to smooth the way . Read my theory on degenerate matter , did you ? It did n't generate much enthusiasm elsewhere . But what do you think we 'll find at the end of the tunnel , Michael ? - A martini . - Probably . Hey ! - Operator . - Berkeley 5558 , please . Hello , Jean . It 's me . - Jean , I know you 're there . - I 'd given up waiting . I 'm sorry . I was n't able to manage ... Oppie , I 've been so frightened . You do n't phone . You do n't write . Not even a message . - I ca n't . - You ca n't ? No , Jean , I ca n't . - Are you coming ? - Well ... - When are you coming ? - Jean . This is n't talking . This is just making noises . Why do n't we just grunt at each other ? - `` I got ta run . There 's a war to win . '' Page 16/55 - Jean . I ca n't remember a day I was n't hurting , except with you . Jean , listen to me . You 've got to understand , please . Yes ? I wo n't keep you , general . Well , you better had . Banging on my door at 2 : I had this typed up , sir . I thought you 'd wan na see it . She 's working him over , general . I 've seen this before . That grunting at each other , could be a code . - The cipher clerk said it 's not code . - Who is this woman ? Jean Tatlock , sir . She 's a known communist . Get me her background . And maybe I am missing some stuff on the good doctor . - Get it for me . - Yes , sir . This must throw Oppenheimer's position on this project into doubt , sir . - Dr. Oppenheimer is the project . - Yes , sir . All due respect , sir , though , doesn't this make him an unacceptable risk ? No ! Failure 's a risk . The thing that concerns me is , if he 's with her , he 's not with us . It might be a good time to put the screws to the doctor . Yes , sir . May I ask , how do you intend to do that , sir ? No , colonel , you may not . - Compression not uniform . - Stand by ! If we had a thinner wall , we could increase the compression , yes ? Page 17/55 Seth , there 's an answer here . Oppie , maybe implosion's just a blind alley . - Are we going again ? - Yes ! - That 's an excuse for not thinking ... - We 'll get reset . All clear ! Reset the charges ! Reset the charges ! - We got all clear ! Let 's go ! - Let 's move ! - Move it ! - On the double ! On the double ! Go ! - Move it ! Move it ! - Bring it in ! Left side ! Left side ! Come on ! Get the lead out ! On the double , guys ! Let 's go ! Canyon to Los Alamos . Come in , Los Alamos . Canyon to Los Alamos . Come in , Los Alamos . Come in . - Something set off the detonators . - Stay back ! They 're wired in series . Get out of there ! - No , Oppie . - Shit . It 's all right . Take it easy , brother . Thanks a lot . Do me a favor . Jump in the ambulance . Let me give you the once-over . You guys are playing with some funny stuff out here . Let 's go . Start them up . Did they teach you that at high school ? You took a risk . I ran out and grabbed the guy . I did n't even think . - Just instinct . Page 18/55 - Instinct , huh ? You know , I wonder , with this war ... ... if it 's instinct to save a man , what makes us want to kill one ? Is that instinct ? You sound like my old man . Why , what 's he like ? - My old man ? - Yeah . He 's a preacher . In Jackson , Illinois . And I got an older brother , Jimmy , and he 's a soldier . My mom 's dead . I do n't know , I guess he 's kind of hurt that I 'm not at the front . - Why ? - Well , Jackson is a small town . - He said , `` Where you going ? '' - I said , `` Santa Fe , New Mexico . '' - I know . - So that did n't quite hack it . He said , '' lf you 're not gon na be a soldier , '' you better be a good scientist . The best . '' - Are you the best ? - I was in Chicago . But these guys are so bright . Sometimes I feel like I 'm in over my head . But I guess I can handle anything they throw at me . But can you dance ? Pardon me ? I said , can you dance ? - Yeah . - Well , do it . - Are you serious ? - Ca n't handle it ? Very nice . - Something like that . - Very good . Page 19/55 Jean Tatlock , graduated in 1932 . They had a thing together before Oppenheimer was married . Seems Tatlock ran off . Things went on the back burner between them till 1942 . Then it all started up again . His associate said , `` lf the wife's his ambition , Tatlock 's his conscience . '' She introduced him to a number of anti-fascist groups , anti-Franco groups and a number of communists . - Bronson . - Sir . Little less muscle on the gas here . Colonel 's starting a mission . I 'd like him alive . Yes , sir . This makes Oppenheimer a sitting duck for blackmail . I 'm gon na insist on his removal . No , you 're not . Just relax . You know , major , if you want to lead a man in a certain direction , you do n't drag him by the nose . You just close off his options . Simple as a truck . Here we are in the top of the ninth . The Army down to the Scientists by one run . Dugan shakes it off . Here 's Merriman 's pitch . That 's a hit . Dugan digging for first base , gon na go for two . Look out . Here 's the throw . Safe at second base on a slide . Apple scores . That ties the game . Yes ? Yes ? ! Bad time ? The velocity 's still presenting us with something of a problem . Page 20/55 Who 's this bimbo you 're running around with ? - What ? - Do I have to tell you ? I got it on the q.t . from somebody who owes me . What if the next guy does n't owe me ? Takes that kind of information to the wrong guy ? That could be the end of you . Could be the end of this project . I do n't understand you . You think you 're some kind of bohemian or something . Blind-sided . I never expected to get blind-sided like this . And there it is . A line drive . Doctor , might I be of assistance ? What about me in all this ? This looks bad . Reflects on me . Reflects on my ability to choose men . I was with this woman before this project . This is not a new thing . It 's no matter . I am not comfortable with the idea that you could sink me . This is someone that I care about . She 's a communist . A communist . Oh , my God . It would be bad enough if she were just some ... ... sweet young thing from Indiana . She 's a card-carrying communist . And your job , classified job . What do I have to do , draw you a map ? Get on the phone , a secure line , tell her ... goodbye ! The pitch . It 's a line drive ! It 's out of there ! It 's gone ! Page 21/55 Home run for Merriman . Home run ! - It 's all right , Bronson , we 'll live . - Yes , sir . Well , that 's it , folks , Scientists win the game . It 's in your court . Bridges , next time keep your head up . All hail the conquering hero . Pencil pushers defeat the doughboys . Robert ! - Frank . - Good to see you , bro . - Are we being followed or something ? - Do n't joke . I nearly asked you for your ID . - That 's ridiculous . - Let 's just leave as soon as we can . They 've been hounding me for names of every person I 've known who had communist sympathies . They monitor every move I make . They listen to my phone conversations . Why stay ? There 's an order to it . An order in some part of my life , at least . I 'm sorry , I did n't get your message till about 5 . I was still at the hospital , and I got all whizzed up into a huge panic . You look wonderful . You look so serious . What 's the matter ? I do n't have much time . I have to go back tonight . Tonight ? I cooked us dinner . This ca n't be about dinner , Jean . I did n't want to tell you on the telephone . And that 's why I 'm here tonight . Is it because of what you 're doing ? Page 22/55 Fine . We 're going to spill the blood before we get to the cocktails . Jean ? Please ... stay tonight . Please . Please . Please . Please . What you 're working on , it 's something bad , is n't it ? That 's why you ca n't tell me . I ca n't tell you because it 's a secret . Tell me one good thing that 's a secret . We were a good thing . No , we were n't . Not when you got married . Give me up for something I can understand . Your wife or your child or your conscience , something alive . Not something that you have to hide . Robert . Oh , Robert , I dreamt you 'd gone . So that 's what the silences were . No letters , no contact . I thought it was me , something I 'd done . - I 've told you it has nothing to do ... - Yes , but you did n't tell me ... What is it you 're working on ? What is so important ? That 's right . It is important . So do n't be so goddamn arrogant . Is it arrogant to want to know where you are ? What 's happening to you ? To want to be close to you ? To understand ? This was the man I loved . I loved his dreams . Page 23/55 I loved what he saw but could n't prove . I loved the goodness in him . He was my proof that the world could be made better . And if he 's dead , I do n't want to live . The world is ... different . It 's just not what we wanted it to be . It 's just not . You mattered to me so much . You really did . She told me that I had a penchant for destruction . That I 'd lost faith . Is she wrong ? No . She 's not wrong . When this war 's over , I want to ride the mesa for six months . No deadlines . Nothing . Thanks , Frank . He just kissed his brother . Got ta be a communist . Set that over there . Look at it , Oppie , it 's twisted . It 's got to be flat . I think implosion 's nothing but a pipe dream . I 'm sorry I thought of it . I ca n't do it . Oppie , some way I have to focus ... I have to focus the shock waves . Look at me ! God , I 'm running out of ideas . That 's an excuse for not thinking . If you ca n't , I 'll find somebody else . Oppie ? Serber needs you back at the lab right now . - Oppie ? - You said it yourself . Focus . Somebody 's working on a way to focus an explosive shock wave . - I 'm gon na find him . Keep working . - Jesus ! Page 24/55 You know , if Oppie does n't let up , he 's going to implode . Inside . Inside . Good news is the new plutonium makes lots of neutrons . But the bad news is the spontaneous fission rate is way too high . The reaction will run away with itself . There will just be a fizzle . - No explosion . - You 're certain of that , Edward ? - Who did the calculations ? - Serber . - Himself ? - Serber , personally . So now plutonium is a problem . That shifts the emphasis back to U-235 . Of course , Oak Ridge is not able to produce that in sufficient quantity . We must go with implosion , but Neddermeyer has just announced to me that he and implosion have just reached a brick wall . We ca n't fall behind . Are you all right , Oppie ? You have a deadline to meet . Banked almost a billion dollars on you guys . That 's not working on the cheap . Only thing I want to hear is , `` Yes , sir . '' Do n't talk to me like I have n't given eight days a week to this project . I 've given up everything . Do n't ... Do n't give me that . I do n't want to hear that from the ... I 've given up everything . You know exactly what I 'm talking about . I do n't give a goddamn that travel was restricted . It had to be done face to face , and that 's the way I did it . Latest news from the fighting front . Page 25/55 American armies are pushing the Germans back on their own territory . But fighting is desperate . The Germans are building up for a massive counter thrust . Though the Allies are determined to hold this new front ... Who 's the Lone Ranger ? Explosives wiz . I do n't know about Tonto . Neddermeyer gave up on his explosion that goes in . Not Oppie , though . He brought in two explosive experts from the outside . We struggle on here in our isolation . And sometimes the war seems a long way away . You want a ride , doc ? Hey , Seth . When did you get your driver 's license ? - You come to see the boys at play ? - Yes . - Oh , bad news , beautiful . - Oh , no . I 'm not gon na be able to make that movie tonight . I can join you both for a drink . It would make you happy . - Sound good ? - Perfect . Right , right . Well , I promised the monkey we 'd be cutting a rug anyway . It 's just as well . Michael , what 's wrong with you ? Do you see much of him ? Yes , I like him . Are you jealous ? Yeah . You better do something about it . Tell them I ai n't buying . White House said Page 26/55 there would n't be any account till after the war . It 's so damn tough to get through to you , I decided to bring you my problem . See the tread on that tire ? Because I sure as hell do n't . Yet that 's what my men are riding around on . I do n't know what kind of deal you got yourself into , Groves , but I do care when it cuts in on my territory . If I 'm gon na move supplies around the country , I need trucks . Those trucks run on tires , Dick . When I hear they ai n't moving because of some tire shortage , I get mad . When I hear you 're the cause of it , I want to kill . - We got ta work something ... - No dice . We got a triple-A priority . White House authority . We need the product . You need to know something . You 're getting a lot of people 's backs up . Let me remind you of something else . See this ? I count two . You got one . When this war 's over , that will amount to something . And , Dick , I hope you get my meaning . Because , by all that 's holy ... ... you better have your ass well-covered . - Well , Bronson . - Sir ? - It 's all about ass , is n't it ? - Sir ? You kick it or you lick it . That 's what it 's all about . I 'm sorry about Page 27/55 my language , Bronson . But I 'm on the limb . My prima donnas better come through ... ... or you are looking at a piece of dead meat . Yes , sir . - What 's this ? - I do n't know , sir . God , almighty . Is this a stop ? What time is it ? There 's no scheduled stop here . Message for General Groves . - I 'll see what the problem is , sir . - Message for General Groves . - Message for General Groves . - In this way . General Groves , sir . This is from Germany . It was flown in . We wired ahead to have the train stopped . Excuse me , gentlemen . - Colonel . - General . Put it in my safe , in the back . Do n't bring it out . That means the Germans don't have the bomb . Were n't close . Sir , is it wise ? I mean , suppressing this ? Well , you tell me , colonel . It 's delicate stuff . I 'm talking about my longhairs , my prima donnas . The Jewish element . Take Hitler out of the equation ... they might just run out of stink . Why chance it ? We can give this country the biggest stick in the playground . And I intend to do that . And I 'll tell you something about our bunch . Page 28/55 Get them close . Then they 'll go all the way . They 're just not close enough yet . Yes , sir . Perhaps you should think of these wedges as forming part of a shell . They do redirect the shock waves in the same way as a lens redirects light . As a matter of interest , we've already used the idea in England for armor-piercing shells . Pray it works . We 'll be back on schedule . Heads up . Watch your backs . No one ever used high explosives ... ... as a precision instrument before . It 's so simple . It just swings the shock waves from convex to concave . - Some orange , hey , Oppie ? - No , after the explosion . Dr. Oppenheimer . Dr. Oppenheimer . A letter for you , sir . - They said it was important . - Thank you . Good luck . We squeezed it ! Damn it , we got compression ! We 're on the way ! The right mix and we 're home , Oppie ! We 're home free , vindicated ! We 're vindicated ! - We got a ball game here . - Seth , come here ! Next stop , implosion ! Can I come in ? Where is he ? He 's out back . Sitting in the sun with a blanket on his lap . Nursing a guilty dick , no doubt . It is not necessary to be vulgar . Page 29/55 Nothing I say could approach the vulgarity of what you 're building in your back yard . Well , vulgar or not ... ... I need him to come through on this . He owes it to his country . He owes it to himself . He is the best there is . And he should have whatever he wants . Do n't try to recruit me , general . You do n't need my help . And spare me your homily on being a good wife . I know it by heart . Why did you put up with her for so long ? Because he 's the best there is . He should have whatever he wants . I do n't live very well alone . Some people do n't . We all have different ways of defending our territory . Concha , you 're late . Peter , hurry up . Did n't I say 2:00 ? I 'm sorry . And I am sorry that the news took so long to get to you . It just got lost in the system censors . You know ... ... you ca n't be responsible for keeping somebody else alive . It is n't possible . It 's not to be expected . I ca n't work on this anymore . I do n't want to . And I do n't need to . Germany is finished . It 's just a matter of time . They ca n't pull this together . - You sure ? - I do n't want to hear your arguments . I already know that everything is a risk . Page 30/55 That the war is not over until it 's over . That they 're lobbing rockets all over London . That Germany is desperate . That she 's resourceful . If she does n't get a device , she could litter England with radioactive material . We thought of something similar . The fact of the matter is ... ... they 're not as good as we are . Or are they ? Christ , I 've got rats in my skull . I 'm being asked to throw too many balls in the air at the same time . When I feel like that , I get down on my knees ... ... and I pray . And that 's how I get conviction . If you let this slip through your fingers , through our fingers , and somebody else gets it ... ... you wo n't be counting how many balls you throw in the air . If you need the fire , you find it . Wherever . At last , some good news . Apparently , sufficient uranium is beginning to arrive from Oak Ridge . But , as brilliant as he is , Oppie's beginning to show the strain . We all depend on Oppie . He 's our inspiration . If he were to crack , we 'd all fall apart . Beautiful , is n't it , Michael ? Just think ... ... a few miles closer to the sun , a few miles farther away , none of this would be here . Just a cloud of gas or a block of ice and nobody to enjoy it . '' Odi et amor '' , '' I hate and I love . '' Page 31/55 - Catullus . Do you know it ? - No . I hate and I love Why , you ask ? I do n't know I feel both And I 'm in agony Maybe General Groves is right . Maybe we should just banish thinking forever . Michael , we have to test the critical mass . - Are you going to help ? - Of course . I want to show you something . Come here to see our little toy , huh ? Michael , that 's what we call tickling the dragon 's tail . So a slug of uranium about two by six inches will be pulled by this weight . It begins here , then accelerates at 32 feet per second per second . It passes between uranium bricks . We have an instant of criticality . For a split second , we have a chain reaction . As close as we come to an atomic explosion in the lab . - Without blowing up . - Exactly . It 's essential to determine the amount of material the device needs . Ten years ago I could hardly imagine the stuff . Ten years . Each molecule collected out of the air , one by one . Hello ? What ? I have the rare privilege of speaking for a victorious army of almost five million fighting men . They and the women who have so ably assisted them constitute the Allied Page 32/55 Expeditionary Force that has liberated Western Europe . They have destroyed or captured enemy armies totaling more than their own strength and swept triumphantly forward over the hundreds of miles separating Cherbourg from Lbeck , Leipzig and Munich . These startling successes have not been bought without sorrow and suffering . In this theater alone , and comparable numbers among the allies have had their lives cut short so that the rest of us might live in the sunlight of freedom . - Yeah ! - Oh , yeah ! What are we gon na do when this is over ? I do n't know . Probably start another one . That 's what I love about this job . A guaranteed future . I 'm not wrong . Believe me , we 're descended from a long line of noble predators . You are irrepressible . I think I 'm gon na go be irrepressible down with Fuller . Come on , baby face . - You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm irrepressible . So , what are you writing ? Something Oppie said today . I do n't know . Well , read it . Go on . Makes you wonder if there 's an intelligence that is n't descended from a long line of predators . I want to kiss you . Come here . Page 33/55 Sir , is it true that since we KO'd Germany , we 're gon na go home ? - I 'll drink to that . - That might be true , soldier . Can I have your attention , please ? Please . Excuse me . Seems to me that we have a shortage of dance partners on the floor . So as a tribute to our men in uniform ... ... l 'd like to make available the services of all the longhairs at Los Alamos on this dance floor . And to break the ceremonial ice , I will choose the first dance partner . General Groves ... may I have this dance ? Why not ? - Why do you have that with you ? - I keep it as a record for my dad . If I wrote him a letter , all he 'd get is black lines . This way I can tell him what 's going on . And what are you gon na write about today ? Besides the war being over ? Yeah . Well , I met this girl . Did I just kiss you up there ? You got ta bring your heads in out of the clouds . Out of the clouds . Keep the muttering to a minimum , please , gentlemen . Some of you dancing ... ... close together . I do n't like the look of it . There are ... bosoms in the area . And this could lead to pregnancy . Any man getting caught out of hand Page 34/55 or getting caught in hand will have to turn their peckers over to the FBI . They 're having fun . That 's nice . They 're entitled . - So long as they do n't think it 's over . - Is n't it ? I mean , what 's all the celebration for ? Perhaps we can find some other use for this work . Fascism 's dead . You mean in Europe . What do they think Japan is doing , shooting squirrels ? No , they 're not shooting squirrels , and that 's not the issue . What is the issue ? They do n't have the technology . They 're not capable of it . So if we do n't need it ... ... why make it ? I want you to look at something . It 's the largest collection of nothing in the entire world . Make them work ... ... and you 've got something . An irresistible something . Just the threat ... ... and they 're ours . You know , sometimes , just standing here , I keep wondering . Are we working on them or are they working on us ? Give them dignity , doctor . Then we can start talking ... ... about who can do what ... ... and what they mean . Oh , what time is it ? Even when I sleep , it 's like dogs tearing at a piece of meat . Robert ? Thinking of resigning ? Page 35/55 No . I 'd be written off . They would n't understand . Not in the present climate . I keep obsessing about the device . Yes , it 's true , but ... ... if you think beyond ... ... it 's a limitless supply of energy . Think about it , Kitty . The power that drives the universe . It 's beyond imagination , really . And we 'd have tamed it . A new world . Go get them , cowboy . What 's going on over there ? Cattle destroyed the entire ground cable run . Ruined two days ' work . Why did n't they herd them outside the site ? Anyone suggest that ? The ranchers would n't move them . Seems the Army stopped negotiating . - This is out of control . - Edward , these estimates ... Rush , push , speed , deadlines . This whole project has gotten out of control . We have n't thought about the consequences , Oppie . - Oppie ? - Wilson ! We 've been waiting for the data for two weeks . When are we gon na get it ? Wilson is correct . We have to talk about what we're all thinking but not saying . This argument is arcane , Edward . This thing is becoming real . It 's going to affect lives , thousands of lives . We have to start to talk . All right . But not here . At my home tonight . So now we tickle Page 36/55 the tail of the dragon . All right , take her up . I can only hope the uranium slug does n't get stuck in the pile . If it does , we 'll probably all evaporate . - What 's the reading ? - 1 .19-K. - Waiting on your word . - Meter 's ready . Ready when you are . Let 's go . OK , let 's tickle it . It burst . It burst . It burst right from here . All right , add it up . Cigarette break . Good job . Michael . Hey , Michael . You got a moment ? They wo n't let me in this place . Still going to Chicago ? Yeah , Frisch ca n't pick the slugs up . Great . There 's something we'd like you to pick up , if you can . You know Leo Szilard , right ? And Ralph Lapp ? Well , about 20 of our other colleagues from Chicago , they 're proposing a petition stating they 're opposed to the device . They 're concerned about what they think 's gon na happen . So am I. I got a brother who's in the Philippines right now . I read the papers . I 'm concerned . I 'm not asking you to endorse anything . I have n't even read it yet . It should be discussed . All I 'm asking is pick it up , let us peruse it and make up our own minds . How tough is that ? - Makes sense . - It 's only fair . Page 37/55 I 'll pick it up for you . - See you later . - OK. How can you rationalize premeditated murder ? Oh , bullshit . Premeditated murder ? - This is a war . It 's about winning . - At what cost ? You ca n't just outlaw a weapon . The more effective , the more likely it will be used . We did n't use poison gas . That was stopped . You got to speak up . The generals wo n't listen to us . Yeah , and speak up on behalf of all those kids hiding in foxholes . I know what they 'd say . The Japanese brought this on themselves . They have themselves to blame . I would n't care if the place went up in smoke ... Excuse me , just for a minute , gentlemen . And I resent your suggesting I do n't recognize a moral argument . Why are you still awake ? Are n't you supposed to be sleeping ? - I do n't like sleeping . - There are lots of things we do n't like . We have to do them if we want to do the things we do like . - What 's the treat tomorrow ? - Go horseback riding . That 's right . Now , how are you going to ride a great big horse if you do n't get plenty of rest ? Go to sleep for Daddy ? That 's a good boy . It is hot . We could go to Carlucci 's , get some ice coffee and donuts . The project is beginning to unravel . - What ? Page 38/55 - There have always been questions . We 've always avoided the answers . Now , everything is coming to a head . - Bronson ? - Sir ? - Stop the car . - Yes , sir . - Get out , take a leak or something . - This is a public park . Well , pick some flowers . I want to do some shouting . It 's a crisis . A crisis of conscience . All right . I 'm not shouting . I 'm not even angry . I am just stumped . You want to sit on your hands , polish your conscience , when we might be able to end this whole thing with one shot ? Crisis of conscience , huh ? All right . Have it . Take a bath in it . Soak in it . Then tell me whether you're going to deliver them . Whether you 're gon na finish this job . You tell me how I 'm gon na face a senate inquiry and say we spent two billion dollars on a show that 's never gon na open . Crisis of conscience . You got one job , doctor . Give me the bomb . Just give it to me . Atrocious things have been done in Germany because people did n't speak out . And we blame them for it . Right , I think , even though it was dangerous . But it 's not dangerous for us to speak out . That 's what a lot of us in Chicago feel . You do n't have to agree Page 39/55 with the contents of this petition . You have to agree it should be discussed . - Yes , sir . - Good boy , Michael . Good seeing you again . - It came in on the wire . - What ? Japanese are feeling out terms for surrender . They made a proposition . What kind of surrender ? Not unconditional ? Not according to my sources , no . Good . No one will buy it . - Sir ? - Nothing . Come on . Come on . Right here . Mr. Secretary , a brutal question . Are you and the president looking to Russia , figuring they 'll come into Japan , assuming there 's an invasion ? If you are , you 're not gon na get that for nothing . Russia 's gon na want Manchuria , Sakhalin . I can give the president Japan . No invasion , no deals . Can you guarantee that ? Some of your scientists are getting out of line . I hear they 've been maneuvering to see the president . I did n't know that . I will take care of it . - Very well . Do that , general . - Mr. Secretary . Good night . Panton ? Dr. Oppenheimer had ... ... on three separate occasions , meetings with suspected agents , communists , whatever . Page 40/55 - He gave us one name , correct ? - Yes , sir . Press him on the others . - He needs to feel the branch creak . - Yes , sir . - Ready ? - Yeah , we 're ready . They told me you were down here . I was having lunch . I got a call from Captain Panton . A security problem again . Well , I 'm being harassed , and I 'm sick of it . I had a security clearance . This was a dead issue . It 's never dead with you . Though I will try to put a lid on it . This is not gon na help . - What 's this ? - Some kind of petition from your boys in Chicago trying to go around us to see the president . That will never happen . Do you know about this ? About the ideas , yes . They want to demonstrate the device , not use it . Is it containable ? Can you stop it ? My hash is getting cold upstairs . - Do n't let these dodos distract you . - How can ... ? Robert , you are this far away from being the man who won the war . These are important people in Chicago . You ca n't ignore what they have to say . All they want is an opportunity to talk about the demonstration . - What 's his name ? Szilard . - Szilard . Sitting in the bathtub . I should have drowned that Page 41/55 son of a bitch the first day I met him . What 's wrong with demonstrating ? What 's wrong with not killing ? You vaporize some uninhabited atoll . Set terms of surrender , then send the Japanese home . It 's mush . It wo n't work . They are kamikazes , all of them . You had money in your background . That explains it . - What does that mean ? - Your optimism . Faith in human nature . I never had any . Money , that is . Never had a permanent house . Made me a realist . The idea should go to the president . Where do you get these ideas ? You know , those boys in security ... ... got a right to ask where these ideas are coming from . Demonstrations , stopping work , sharing with other countries . You 're gon na have a tough time proving that those ideas are coming out of Chicago . - They are foreign , subversive . - They 're moral . - Moral ? - Moral . Was Pearl Harbor moral ? Poland , Munich , moral ? Death March of Bataan , was that moral ? Junk ! Demonstration junk . I say you show the enemy in the harshest terms that you can muster , that you play in the same league that they do . At that meeting tomorrow there's gon na be a vote on this demonstration . There 's gon na be a recommendation Page 42/55 going to the president . Now , listen . You can help yourself here . Steer it in the right direction . You 're either for us or against us . Ernest , how are you ? I 'd like to introduce Dr. Oppenheimer here . Well , rumor has it that we might owe you for shaking those yellow monkeys out of the trees . Save us a lot , not going to Japan . My boys are gon na be grateful . Yes , I 'm pleased to shake your hand . And thank you . Doctor , I 'd like to add my shake too . Nice seeing you . Did you hear what they said ? You keep this on the track , and we are gon na owe you , soldier . '' We are in a completely new situation that can not be resolved by war . '' A petition to the president of the United States . '' Discoveries of which the people are not aware '' may affect the welfare of this nation in the near future . '' The Russians are our allies . If we drop this without telling them , we could give them a paranoia that will make us sick . The Japanese are on their knees . All this kamikaze stuff is a load of bull . They 're wet-pants scared of us just like we 're wet-pants scared of them . This war seems to have forced a lot of guys on both sides to resign from the human race . - I hope we 're not about to do that . - I agree . Our blockade will finish Japan by autumn , maybe even sooner . Page 43/55 This device is not an honorable way to win a war . And I was taught to fight with honor . If Custer ... ... had used the machine-gun ... ... his history would have been written differently . If you go ahead , particularly , if you drop this thing with no prior warning ... ... l , for one , will have to resign my commission . Perhaps you 'll excuse me , gentlemen . Incidentally , what is the opinion of the committee on a demonstration ? Well , if we should agree to a demonstration with the attendant Japanese observers and that demonstration failed , not only would we be unable to induce the Japanese to surrender , we would face a critical shortage of material . The dropping of the device has always been implicit in this project . So that is the advice I shall pass on to the president . - Yes , sir . - Yes , that 's right . Yes . - Sam . - Bob , welcome to Trinity . - Here she is . - Can I grab one ? - It 's all right . - Good trip ? - Are you the accountable officer ? - Yes . - This will be for you . - What 's that ? It states that the University of California hands over a plutonium core of a nuclear device Page 44/55 to the United States Army . Put more simply , it 's a bill for two billion dollars . Now , let me show you what else your money 's bought . The initiator . And the other half . Now , all we got ta do is throw them together and ... Well , let 's begin final assembly . OK , Mr. Merriman . Well , you 're quiet . It 's coming close , what you're working towards , is n't it ? Yeah . I can feel it pressing down on everybody . There 's something going on here . It 's got everybody mesmerized , does n't it ? Yeah . There 's a regular run on sleeping pills and aspirin . And it 's not just the work , it 's something else . - Look , I know you ca n't talk about it . - I ca n't . Well , then talk to Dr. Oppenheimer . I mean , if anyone has , he 'll have thought it through , right ? OK. Touch me . Naked . Is n't that a beautiful word ? Tonight . I want to make love . And I want a future . That 's what I really want ... ... for you and me . So do I . - Oh , for chrissake , George . - This pitting , must be the mold . I 'm not an explosives expert , but I 've been called Page 45/55 to look at something that 's unacceptable . We must use hand lathings . You should have used hand lathings before . - Hand lathings , you know what it is ? - Yes . - Michael , what are you doing here ? - Chicago , Leo Szilard . I read it on the train . - Well , what do you think about it ? - It unnerved me . Are we gon na discuss this ever ? Amongst ourselves ? - Are we going on ? - I do n't see anyone stopping . Now , look , we 've been asked to solve a technical problem , to build this device . We 're not responsible for its use . Oppie , it 's for you . Peter 's got revised figures . Look , let me keep this paper . We 're expecting the initiator . We need your lab results , all right ? All right ? All right . Everybody ready ? - Meter 's ready . - Here we go . Twenty-one . Twenty-nine . Thirty-one . Thirty-eight . Got it ? Forty . Everybody back , right now . Behind the wall . Turn it off ! Nobody move ! Do n't anybody move ! Damn it ! Take off everything metal . Drop it . Mark the positions you 're standing in and get out . The incident never happened . Page 46/55 If anyone should ask , it did not happen . Everybody should make it . Except me . I 'm dead . Doctor ! Doctor ! I 've been looking all over for you . We 've got a problem . - Bad allergy . - When ? - An hour ago . They 're bringing him in . - Who ? Mr. Merriman . - Michael ? - Yes , sir . Oh , shit . Let 's go . - Come on , let 's go ! - Yes , sir . This one wo n't do . - In here . This one 's good . - Take it easy . All right , all right . - Michael , what 's the matter ? - Nothing , everything 's fine . - Doctor , how much did he get ? - More than 1 ,000 rads . - Goddamn it . - What 's happening ? Sweetheart , it 's under control . Everything 's under control , OK ? - Steven , what 's going on ? - You should not be here . Excuse me , there 's no patient here . No one 's to hear about this . Not Oppenheimer . Nobody . - OK ? - Goddamn it , what happened here ? I want this ward sealed off . Come with me . I want military doctors in here . Get the hell out of here ! It 's the detonation circuits . I do n't know . I would like another 24 hours . Page 47/55 I think so , but I ca n't be certain . I said one more day . I need one more day . No , no , Merriman brought me a copy from Chicago . Some of the physicists have signed it . Pinko fruitcakes . Get that thing to work , I 'm gon na drop it on Chicago . I swear I will . Yes , I hear you . You hear me ? Finish the damn thing . That 's an order . Well , I got other business . But I got a plane . I 'll be there . Every time I turn around , somebody gets to him . Now they 're talking about postponing . - Cleared for Washington ? - Yes , sir . We are . '' Truman , Stimson arrive Potsdam for conference with Stalin . '' Advise results of Trinity Test soonest . '' Stalin 's gon na eat Truman alive at this meeting . - Unless we ... - Yes , unless ... ... we give the president something lethal to stick in his back pocket . I 'll tell you something it wo n't be ... postponement . Oh , Lord ... so close . Sir . Keep going down slow . His heart looks larger . Could be fluid in the pericardial sac . - Radiation induced ? - Probably . It 's almost doubled in size overnight . If this continues , his heart will drown . - Is he lucid ? - In and out . There 's tremendous brain swelling from the radiation . - What happens next ? Page 48/55 - I do n't know . I mean , I have no idea . No human being 's ever gotten this dose of radiation before . He 's dying from the inside out . Other problems . His gastrointestinal tract has been destroyed by radiation . Excuse me , doctors . You 've got to believe we 're doing everything we know how . Absolutely everything . It 's not gon na do any good to have you ripping yourself apart . - You 've got ta go home and sleep . - Richard , I ca n't . - Some orange . - Sure is . Hey , Oppie ? Look out ! Hornig ? - Hornig ? - It 's all right . The other safety 's holding . Does anybody else need a martini ? - What 's the word ? - Oppie , it does n't look good . We have a chance of thunderstorms over the next five days . I 'm sorry . I 'm not telling you what this guy 's got up there . - Why was n't I told ? - Too much panic . - How is he ? - Difficult to tell . - I 'd like to see him . - We 're not permitting visits . But the men who were with him have been spoken to . Security . Delicate time . He 's a strong young man . He 'll pull through . Schoenfield , how is he ? - Is he conscious ? - He 's in and out . He wants to know Page 49/55 if you read the petition . - It means a lot to him . - Yes , I have . And then , that 's it ? That 's all ? Yes , I have and then now I wash my hands of it ? Now wait a minute , Oppenheimer . I got a friend falling apart who thinks you got the answers . That 's what you let him think . Do you know what the Christ is going on , or is the whole thing out of control ? If you 're trying to make a point , what is it ? I have spent the last two years of my life putting up with all your security and your secrecy and your control . I do n't think that bullshit was to keep what was going on from the Germans or the Japanese or the Russians . It 's to keep it from American Jacks and Jills because they may not like what 's going on . American people don't want to know what 's going on . They want to know that their sons are alive . I 'm doing everything in my power to see that they do . Like Oak Ridge , where they're injecting ill and old people with huge doses of plutonium ? I do n't know about Oak Ridge , but if you want to ask what 's happening , ask this : Will it be big enough ? Big enough to scare all of us and make us stop and think ? Big enough to stop all war forever ? You want to ask a question , ask that . Look , I 've seen Oak Ridge , all right ? Page 50/55 That place was n't built to make one or two bombs . It was built to make thousands of them . Thousands . And soon everybody's gon na have a bomb . They will . What do they do with them ? Sit and wait till they go off , until `` boom '' ? Then we got one world full of Michael Merrimans dying from the inside out . Is that what you 're looking for ? Because that 's the future you 've made for us . Hey , Oppenheimer ! Oppenheimer , you ought to stop playing God because you are not good at it and the position is taken . His pressure 's falling fast . You 've got to get that fluid out now . Needle , Michael . OK , you 're in . Start to pull it back . Hang in , Michael . Hang in , pal . Come on , doc . Pressure 's starting to rise . It 's coming up slowly . - Robert , you have to get some sleep . - God . I 'm in a dark place . We 've all cooked this stew . The Germans and the Japanese and the Americans and the Brits . It 's an ugliness that goes back . It goes way back . I 'm not a scientist anymore . I 'm a goddamn functionary . I 've got to stay in control . I 've got to control who gets this thing . Power and control , it 's all I ever hear about anymore . Does n't life matter to you ? What about love and understanding ? I thought that 's what science Page 51/55 was all about . I just wanted us to work . Does everything have to be sacrificed to this ... thing ? I put up with ... ... Jean , because I thought you needed her . And I thought you 'd give her up because of me . But she did n't count . I do n't count . Nothing counts for you anymore except this damn bomb . That 's what it is . But it 's not your only creation . There are the children . And you need my love and support . I know . I do n't ... I do n't know where it is . Why me ? Why did he pick me ? - Panton ! - Sir ? Security 's a mess . Nobody at the checkpoint . Nobody up here . - What do you think this is , a beach ? - No , sir . We 've got to call a halt . The weather is unpredictable . We are not calling a halt on account of weather . With the wind we could send radioactive junk all the way to Amarillo . You The New York Times reporter ? I want three reports . One if we succeed , one if we fail and one if we disintegrate . With the wind blowing this direction , Amarillo could get a fallout . - Fermi 's right . - No , I 'm saying no . The decision is mine ! - Do you understand ? - We ca n't do it . Page 52/55 We go ahead with this . Sergeant , do something about that dog . You sound like you 're planning a railway schedule . No , you are trying to uninvent this . I can do it without you . Well , if you do and I 've said no and something goes wrong ... Get in the car . Hurry up . What are you waiting on ? Sir , it looks like it 's clearing up . You know , you build to a moment , and then you grab it , or it will go right by you . You always thought that I would do this , did n't you ? Can you buck your own nature ? What will it be like ? Unimaginable . It 's your baby . Do it . Hallelujah . He said it 's a go . Let 's go . Start the countdown . Come on . It 's a go . - Let 's go ! Move it out ! - Wilson , wake up ! - Wake up the dragon . - Let 's go . Let 's go . Power on . - Power on . I love you , Michael . Easy . Breathe easy . Easy . Easy , come back to the ice . It 's OK , here 's the ice . Kathleen , what are you doing in here ? Kathleen ? God ! Come on , come on , sweetheart . - You simply ca n't be here , sweetheart . - I had to be with him . Page 53/55 I wanted to tell him I love him , because he 's going to die . Detonation relays four open . Well , it 's armed . - Now it 's up to the bunker . - Let 's get down from here . Well , I 've always believed that the Lord was on our side . And I think now we 're gon na prove it . - Must be from the military base . - Enrico , what do you bet on the yield ? I bet we set fire to the atmosphere . If we 're lucky , we only wipe out New Mexico . If we can ignite the air , we finish off the planet . Any takers ? I kind of hope the damn thing does n't go off . What the hell is that ? It 's The Nutcracker Suite . I ca n't get rid of it . - Go to six-five . - Six-five . - OK , try seven . - Seven . Charging the device . Robert , over here . The device is fully charged . It is now zero minus 60 seconds . Fifty-nine , 58 , - 53 , 52 , 51 , 50 , 49 ... - Where is that music coming from ? It 's a ground channel . I ca n't get rid of it . Goddamn music . nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , zero . Kathleen , my love . You asked me a question once . Was it instinct to save a life or to take it ? Well , I do n't know , my darling . All I do know is that if we are free to choose , Page 54/55 I hope to God we choose life over death . Not because I believe the implacable universe cares a damn , but because as I look at you , my darling , I realize how glorious , how magical life can be . Page 55/55

2004;"Scripts.com Hawking By Peter Moffat Page 1/30 It has to be back to the beginning . Is that what he 's doing ? Yes , yes . Good . One thing I have to know before we start . When did you meet him ? Back then ? In 1963 you 're talking about . What did you make of him ? We did n't . We did n't meet him . He was in England , we were in New Jersey . Wait a minute We did n't even know he existed . Did we know he existed ? We had no idea who he was , Stephen Hawking . Who 's he ? - Fifteen years ago Bob . - Can you believe it ? - Time flies , huh ... There was no beginning of the universe . Past , present , future , the universe has always existed , and it always will . - Stephen ? - It stays the same . Stephen ? ! What is it ? What is it ? ? OK wait , how long we got here ? I do n't wan na be late , Arno Penzias was late for his Nobel Prize ? I do n't think so . - Are we filming now ? - Yes . I swear to you , that this is the most profound thing you will hear in your entire life . The sound or the story ? The sound or the story ? What 's the difference ? There you are . Your mother sent me to find you . -- a new matter , which is being created to replace old matter , this process has always existed and will continue forever . Nothing changes , nothing has ever changed . Page 2/30 It 's my theory . And I 've given it a name . I 've called it `` steady state '' . - Good night . - Good night professor Hoyle . That 's Hoyle ? That 's Hoyle . - Hello . - Hello . Who are you ? I 'm Jane Wilde . - We have n't , have we ? - No . I 'm a friend of Stephen 's . We met at another party and he invited me to this party . Isobel ! Hello . - How are you ? - Fine . Good . You ? - I 'm still fine , thanks ! - Sorry . Your um.your ... Oh no , thanks . Thank you very much . - Oh , they 're a terrible fiddle , are n't they . - Yes . Terrible . Thanks . Stephen ! It 's a party . People might want to dance . You ca n't dance to Wagner . To Stephen ! Happy birthday . - Should we go outside ? - What ? It makes me feel ... small . Very small . All that out there . Us , here . Do n't worry . Galileo was wrong . St. Albans is absolutely the centre of the universe . - Galileo died , 321 years ago today . - On your birthday ? Changed the way we thought about everything . People are frightened of change . My father and I used to come out here Page 3/30 in the middle of the night to look at stars . I actually saw a star die once . Course it actually happened about 200 000 years ago , but the news did n't reach St. Albans until 1956 - light 's fast , but it is n't that fast . Sorry . Physics . They 're all so far away . But they do n't seem it , I mean , you feel like you might stretch and reach and you might just touch them . Better hurry up with your stretching and reaching because they 're getting further away . What ? The galaxy is moving away from us . The closer ones at about six million miles an hour and the distant ones at about two hundred million miles an hour . I believe in God . - Oh sorry , I just wanted to say it , I do n't know why . - It 's alright . You said you felt small . Does God make you feel less small ? There 's nothing wrong with feeling in science , feeling matters . All the best ideas are felt and argued about later . Einstein said he could feel in his little finger if an idea was right . - So you 're in good company . And you like Wagner . - Actually ... - No , I do n't . I think he 's ... - What ? Pompous . And ridiculous . - Who do you like then ? - Rachmaninoff . - What ? - Nothing . Brahms ? - Stephen ? - I did n't say anything . - The Beatles . - Who ? - Nevermind . - Jane ? Yes ? - Please , please me . - What ? Love me , do . Page 4/30 We should go in . - I ca n't get up . - Come on . - I ca n't ! - Very funny ! I ca n't get up Jane ! I 'll go and get help . Hello ? Jane ? Hello ? Can you hear me ? - What 's wrong with you ? - I ca n't get up . Well , give me your hand . - Will it hurt ? - The truth ? Yes . A little bit more . That 's good . Now hold , hold still . This might be a little bit more uncomfortable . - How old are you Stephen ? - I 'm 21 . - How old are You ? - I 'm older than you . - How much older ? - I 'm 33 . Same age as Marilyn Monroe in Some like it hot . And what do you do ? Oh no , wait let me guess . Umm , insurance salesman ? Or banking maybe ? - I 'm aI 'm a cosmologist . - Oh , good for you ! Just started my PhD . Or rather I 've just started to think about what my PhD might be . Now this will take about five minutes . Sometimes it helps to talk about something completely different . To take your mind off all this . And then your time suspended in space will pass more quickly . - Time and space do not exist independently of each other . - Is that so ? Or the universe . Really ? Matter and energy in the universe warp and distort space-time . Space-time 's curved . Hello ? No . No , we do n't know . Lots of tests . Page 5/30 Yes he is . Goodbye . - Who was it ? - The girl from the party . The x-ray of your spine with the dye in shows that you do n't have anything pressing on your spinal cord . - That 's good is n't it ? - It 's a process of elimination . You were a team . I mean you 're both getting the Nobel Prize this evening . I put him up for the job . And they would n't let me in on an interview . So I loitered around . And when Bob and the interview committee came out doing their handshakes and thank you for coming and we 'll let you know , I moved in . You gave him the job , right ? You gave Bob the job , did n't you ? There was this kind of embarrassed pause , so I told them straight . Bob and I are gon na walk down the corridor right here and right out that door right there . And if you do n't want Bob to have a job that he was born to do , then you call it before we go through that door . - Longest walk of my life . - Sixty two paces . And we never looked back . - They wo n't tell me what they 're thinking . - Doctors do n't . - They do n't know themselves yet . - I 'm a doctor , Isobel , I know what they 're like . - You 're tropical disease expert , dad . - I know doctors ! - What Isobel ? - Nothing . I 'll arrange for you to have a private room . No . I 'll stay on the ward like everyone else . So , have you applied for Oxford or Cambridge ? They do n't want me . I was thinking of Westfield . It 's an all ladies college . On the Burton model , I suppose . And .. and it 's quite Scrabble . Let 's play scrabble . Page 6/30 Leukaemia . He 's twelve . It was beautiful . I came out of the woods and there it was . A perfect piece of equipment . The antenna . A great big horn like a gramophone horn lying on its side . The size of a house . In the middle of a field , on a hill , 20 miles out of New York City . - Picking up the hiss . - Pointing at the stars . And picking up the hiss . And at the first time I saw that horn , you know what ? - Well , they flew right out of her . - Who ? The pigeons . The twenty foot horn had a couple of pigeons living inside it . - Pigeons ? - Pigeons ! What was it for , the 20 foot horn ? Apart from pigeon nesting . We wanted to measure noise from the outer edges of the Milky Way . - Arno built a cold load . - What 's that ? - Five imperial gallons of liquid helium . - You know how much helium that is ? It 's a hell of a quantity of helium . Gives you an unbelievably accurate reference against which you can measure the noise you receive . Arno was very precise . He makes these things better than anyone . - Maybe it 's the German in me . - You 're German ? First six years of my life and a big chunk of my temperament . Bob made a great switch . To connect the receiver alternately to the antenna and the cold load reference . Were you born in Germany ? - When ? The 1940 's ? Page 7/30 - No . 1930 's . Noise is heat . The higher the heat the more intense the noise . You may wan na ask , did we get noise ? We got a lot of noise . Which means a lot of heat . Far more than a Milky Way should have given us . That was our work from then on in . Day after day , what 's all this heat ? What the hell is this hiss ? ! Died in the night , poor lamb . What 's happening to me ? - Usually , I would sit down with the patient and his family - Please . Motor neurone disease . What , what is it , what happens ? Motor neurones in the brain , which signal movement , they are dying . So ? The brain stops telling muscles to move , the signal 's not sent , the muscles are not used , so they waste away slowly . - How slowly ? - Muscle wastage causes immobility . - How slowly ? - It 's gradual paralysis . And then , then what ? The respiratory muscles unlike most other muscles , work automatically . - Breathing . - Yes . They do n't waste away so quickly . - But they do , they do waste away . - Yes . So what , I wo n't be able to breathe properly ? Or I wo n't be able to breathe at all , something like , um , drowning ? What about the brain , I mean the brain itself ? Untouched . The brain is left untouched . He 's young , that 'll work in his favour . Frank ? I remember when he was about eight years old and we were in the garden with a telescope . And Stephen said to me : where do stars come from ? I did n't know the answer . Page 8/30 And you called him into bed and ... ... he wanted to know the answer to his question very badly . And I said not to worry , I 'd find out for him . I never did . - You 've never been a sentimental man , Frank . - No . - I do n't think we can afford for you to start now . - I looked it up . The younger you are when you get motor neurone disease , the quicker the deterioration . Being young is a ... is a bad thing Isobel . Two years probably , no more . - Then we must support him . - Yes . You do it by carrying on ! You do it , by living and carrying on ! He 's going back to Cambridge , to his life . - Do you know what Hoyle says ? - What ? If you could drive the car straight upwards , you 'd reach space in half an hour . How long to drive around the Milky Way ? You multiply the diameter of the galaxy by the distance of one light year . - Easy . - The calculation ? The car . Just been to India and back , remember ? - How long does it take to complete a PhD ? - Depends on the subject . - With the fair-wind ? - With the fair-wind and a good brain , two years . - What 's the name of your supervisor ? - Sciama . Dennis Sciama . 5 869 713,6 million miles - around the Milky Way . The heat we were receiving from out there , should have been two degrees colder than the cold load , the reference . - But it was hotter , three degrees hotter . - Hotter than the Milky Way could produce . Hotter than the sum of all the galaxies beyond . So we think .. It had to be something closer to home . We had an idea . Was that you who had the idea ? Page 9/30 I do n't remember . Oh we had a whole laundry list of ideas . Maybe it was me . Maybe it was you . You were a team . - Maybe it was me . - What was the idea ? There was some high-altitude bomb testing back in the 50 's . Maybe it 's the leftover radiation , maybe our hiss is fallout . But it would 've diminished over the time and what we were getting - Totally constant . No diminishing . - Back to the laundry list . Sciama . Dennis , yes . I do n't know . S-H-A-R-M-A ? Um , I think it 's Italian . Dennis Sciama ? - Yes ? - Frank Hawking . Hello , young man . - Do I know you ? - Stephen Hawking . - I applied for you to supervise my PhD . - Too busy was I ? Yes I think so . - Brains , balls and cash . - I 'm sorry ? Physics , in this country , it 's a battlefield and a bloody one . You need brains , which ought to be enough , but it is n't cause you need cash to fund whatever you 're brain 's working on , ... ... and to get cash out of anyone in this country you need balls , because they 'll try and stop you . You 'll see . You found a subject ? Any ideas ? - I do n't know yet . - Well when you do , remember this . You 'll have to fight for what you believe in tooth and nail or the buggers will stop you . Physics means everything to him . I want him to be happy , Mr. Sciama . - What can I do ? - I want you to set him a question that he can ... finish . Something easy enough for him to finishbefore he dies . Could you do that ? Please ? Page 10/30 My students and my science are everything to me . I try to be true to both . Which is why I ca n't do what you ask me Dr. Hawking . I 'm sorry . Cosmology . The ghetto science . All speculation and no proof . The ghetto science ? How did we get here , where are we going , what is time ? - It asks all the big questions . - Stephen ! Have you got a subject ? Have you brought a big idea back with you ? - No . - Plenty of time . Plenty of time . The greatest achievement of physics in the twentieth century Rutherford , Oppenheimer , what have they given us ? The atomic bomb ? What 's the point in asking , how we got here and where are we going , if Einstein and your mob have already got us ready for anything . Blaming Einstein for that is like blaming Isaac Newton for plane crashes because he discovered gravity . Very clever , very smart . But smartness is n't the real world , is it ? - Cosmologists are n't interested in the real world . - You see that girl ? - What about her ? - Stephen 's going to make her fall in love with him . - Using only Einstein 's theory of relativity . - What ? ? ? - A pound says it ca n't be done . - I really do n't think this is a good idea . The honour and integrity of our entire subject is at stake here . Alright , alright , I 'll do it . One gin and tonic and I think that 's Excuse me , have you got the time please ? I make it half past seven . What time do you make it ? - You already know the time . - I know my time . Page 11/30 Are you trying to be funny ? Time 's not a universal quantity . We used to think that it was , we used to think that it was just there , marching on at the same pace for everyone everywhere , ... ... like a railway track that stretched to infinity . Time was eternal . Now we know that it is n't . - Wow . - You have to know this is incredibly important . Time 's not a background thing , it 's not an absolute , it can switch , everything else is measured . It 's dynamic . - Dynamic ? - Active . - Active ? - Wonderful . If you were to travel East very very quickly - Out of sight , to the Far East ? - The Far far East . Oh completely out of sight . Yes , completely out of sight . And I stayed here your time would slow down relative to mine . - Like I 'd get really really slow ... - If you went very very fast . If I went very very fast , I 'd get really really slow . Your time would , relative to mine . Totally out of sight . Time 's very important . - What star sign are you ? - What ? I do n't know . - You alright ? - Fine . - Beer ? - Yes please . Did you want another ? Who is that ? Roger Penrose . Brilliant brain . He 'll be a professor within three years . Sorry , could I ? The thing is just then , um ... I was thinking about mathematics and not beer , and sometimes when I 'm thinking in a number of different dimensions Page 12/30 I ca n't come back very quickly to words and beer , and whether I want more of it . It 's because of the pictures in my head , uh ... I do n't know how to make the words come . You see ... - Pint or ... ? - Yes , please . Poor orchestration , overly romantic , Wagner despised him . The feeling was mutual . - What ? - Brahms despised Wagner . Well you ca n't get compare the two . For one thing the ... - Stephen ! - Yes ? Hello . Hello . - Are you alright ? - I 'm fine . - Denmark 's a prison . - Then is the world one . A goodly one ; in which there are many confines , wards and dungeons . Denmark being o ' of the worst . We think not so , my Lord . Why then , 't is none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so : to me it is a prison . Why then your ambition makes it one ; 'tis too narrow for your mind . Oh God , I cold be bounded in a nut shell , and count myself a king of infinite space , were it not that I have bad dreams . What are you thinking ? - I was ... thinking about Einstein and relativity . - Oh ! - And stars . - Oh . It 's possible for a perfect star to collapse into nothingness . If it 's a perfect sphere then it can collapse and become infinitely dense , so dense that everything is pulled down into nothing . Page 13/30 But the conditions have to be right . What conditions ? If it is a perfect sphere , if the place be very moving , if the evening 's very beautiful , the conditions have to be ideal . It 's possible for the pull of gravity to stop everything escaping . Everything in nothing . - Oh no ! - Was n't that bad , was it ? My bag , I left it in the theatre . Ah ... Shall we ? Oh we can see a star , look . There , you see ? Found it ! Hamlet does n't act . That 's his fatal flaw , if he acted , if he did something - It would be a shorter play . - He 'd save his life . Everybody wants Fred . I 've been thinking about a subject for you . - Faraday rotation . - Boring . - Mach 's principle ? - Formulations I 've seen are not well defined . - They 're my formulations . - Action ! The universe expands . As galaxies move apart , new galaxies are formed to fill the gaps left behind . The new replaces the old at just the right rate . Nothing changes . Wherever you are in the universe ; Andromeda , Mars or Scarborough , it always looks the same . Because it is the same . I want to do something significant . The universe is a steady state universe . - It is very attractive , steady state , right ? - Cut ! Thank you . - And reassuring . - Yes . Maybe it 's attractive because its reassuring . Emotionally its far harder to conceive of a universe that 's started , a universe that has n't always been around . Page 14/30 - Einstein ? - Look what he did when his work looked like it was predicting there was a beginning to the universe . He ran away from the prospect to the beginning . No because he saw that the beginning would mean a breakdown of all the laws of science . How can science explain something that is n't there ? That 's the thing about the idea of a Big Bang . The thing about the idea of a Big Bang is that it 's wrong . Irrational and wrong . It 's my term , Big Bang . I made it up . Do you know why I called it that ? Because it sounds like a cartoon . Big Bang theory is cartoon physics . Dennis agrees , with me , do n't you Dennis ? Lunch ? - The Pope was a Big Bang man . - Because ? Because before the Big Bang , there was nothing ! No space , no time , no matter . No science , no rules , which leaves room for guess who ? Lord God almighty . Religion is the enemy of science , young man . If Catholicism had its way , we would all still be living on a flat Earth at the centre of the universe with hell down below and heaven just somewhere to the left of the moon . This is 1963 . God is dead . Stay away from Big Bangs , cartoons are bad for you . - White dielectric material . - I 'm sorry ? Lots of it . Inside the antenna horn . It had to be it . It had to be the cause of the hiss . - White dielectric material ? - Yes . Pigeon shit . All over the horn . - You know what we did ? - Unbelievable . - What did you do ? - We posted them . - The pigeons ? - We posted the pigeons . The people we work for had internal mail Page 15/30 and offices all over America . We posted the pigeons as far away as we could send them . - Did it work ? - They came home . - They were homing pigeons . - They were n't ready to leave . So what did you do ? - He .... he , um ... - We ... had the pigeons shot . - No , Bob had the pigeons shot . - You killed the pigeons ? - A technician . - A technician killed the pigeons . And then we cleared out all the white dielectric material from inside the horn . On our hands and knees in our white lab coats , inside the horn scraping away the white stuff . - And ? - The pigeons were innocent . The hiss was still there . The pigeon shit was not the hiss . Is that alright ? Can I say that on television ? What am I doing wrong Dennis ? - Dennis ? - Yeah . - Do you hink I could have some more paper ? - Dennis 's study . You know where it is . It 's Stephen . I think they 're gon na like each other , you watch . Another lunch of advanced theoretical physics . - Hello . - Hello . Tomatoes . Could you ? Thin slices . - Hello . Roger Penrose . - Yes , I know . Have you two met ? Prosciutto . Help yourselves . Mozart could go to sleep and wake up with whole symphonies in his head and no idea how they got there . A whole symphony in his head , complete . How can that be ? Music is temporal . How can you pack a whole symphony into just one moment ? Page 16/30 Well maybe it 's because music is a way of thinking that is way beyond language . Maybe that 's what genius is . Thinking without time . All roads lead to physics . I think thought , mathematical thought , can exist completely without words . I do n't think thinking is verbal . In fact , I think words come in the way . I think you can do it without words . Poets have always been obsessed with time . - Shrinking it , controlling it , stopping it . - T. S. Eliot ? `` Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future , and time future contained in time past . '' Rupert Brooke : '' Stands the church clock still at ten to three ? '' Blake : and a heaven in a wild flower , hold infinity in the palm of your hand , and eternity in an hour . '' - L. I. Merick . - Who ? `` There was a young lady named Bright , whose speed was faster than light . She set out one day in a relative way and returned on the previous night . '' - It 's unstable . - Sorry ? - Go on . - It 's unstable . You need a negative energy field in order to create the new matter , which makes it unstable . - Hoyle 's steady state ? - It 's problem , is n't it ? Is n't it ? - You like Hawking very much , do n't you ? - Hm . - Will he have the time ? - What ? Page 17/30 Does he have enough time left to get what he 's after ? I hope so . A time-symmetric new theory of gravity . It 's brilliant . Hoyle at his best . - Did you start as his PhD student ? - Are you after my job ? - Did you ? - Are you ? - No . - Yes . He 's a great scientist . His work on the production of uranium inside stars is - what 's the word ... Beautiful . And so is this . I do the checking . It should be refereed by a committee but Hoyle does n't have time . Can I see it ? - I have to go . - Just give me a few more minutes . - I have to go now . - Leave it with me . - OK , but do n't - What ? Eat it ? Just leave it on my desk . Up early ? - Are you alright ? - Yes , fine . You look like you 've had a wild night . Something like that . So the Royal Society this afternoon ? - You 're giving the paper today ? - Yes . You remember Stephen Hawking ? The new theory we have formulated differs in its global implications from the usual theory in that , whereas in the usual theory the negative sign at the constant of proportionality which appers in the field equations , is chosen arbitrarily . In the new theory , there 's no such ambiguity . The sign must be minus , and further the magnitude of g follows on from a determination of the mean density of matter , thereby enabling the cosmologist to know how hard he 'll hit the ground if he falls off a cliff . Any questions ? You want to say something young man ? Page 18/30 Your calculation is wrong . The advanced field diverges . - The advanced field does not diverge . - I 'm afraid it does . It 's all wrong . Would you like to tell us how you know this , young man ? I worked it out . - You worked it out during the lecture ? - No , I had a privileged early glimpse at the paper . - Who put you up to that ? - What ? That stunt in there . Who put you up to it , eh ? - Somebody 's put you up to sabotaging me . - It 's just wrong , that 's all . I had to say it , did n't I ? The physics is wrong . Why did you show him the paper ? I hate them being shown to any bugger . - Science is n't theatre . - It needed to be said . In that way ? How long has it been , since you 've started with me ? - You do n't like the idea of me attacking steady state theory ... - You did n't answer my question . - ... because you 're a steady state man yourself . - OK , I 'll answer it for you . Twelve months . - So the idea of me attacking the steady state theory ... -My father ran a cotton mill . When I was twenty-one , I told him I wanted to be a physicist . He hated the idea . He wanted me to take over the business from him . So he told me that I could n't be a physicist , unless I got a fellowship to pay for it . He thought I would n't get it . He thought I would buckle . - And I worked like a dog ... - What does this have to do with me attacking steady state ... I know what it is like to have obstacles in your path . I know what it 's like to be told you ca n't do something . That 's why I became a teacher . I would never , ever stop a student of mine from pursuing something because I did n't agree with their opinion . Never . I know you can do more than make brilliant attacks on others . Do something ! All of your own . Page 19/30 Be original . Look out ! Maybe it 's New York ! - Maybe the hiss is New York we said . - New York ? How ? We figured , that if any city in the world can give you three degress of hot radio noise , it must be the Big Apple . My family alone could probably make this much hiss . - We were struggling to think what else it could be . - You were guessing ? How could we claim to be making very sensitive radio astronomy measurements , with all that manmade stuff around . We pointed the antenna at New York City , all that energy spread out across the northern horizon ; arcing from subway rails , hum from power lines , the radar amplifier at Kennedy Airport spewing out radio noise by the kilowatt . And I 'm thinking , just maybe , just maybe , this town , this town of all towns might crank up three degrees of hiss . You said you were from Germany . When did you leave Germany ? Maybe we should stop filming ? I came to America when I was six years old . We lived in a two room apartment in the garment district . Me , my brother and my parents and the cockroaches in the kitchen . We were poor . That 's why I became a physicist . Not to get rich , not to win the Nobel , to stop being poor . New York was n't it . We pointed the 20 foot horn at the city and it gave us a reasonable amount but - Not enough heat . - Not enough . To win the Nobel Prize , you have to find something . Am I right ? It 's not about thinking , or theory ... - It 's about discovery . - But do you have to be looking for the thing that you find ? Science can be slow work . It 's hardly ever about Eureka moments in the bath . You need precision , tenacity , dedication . German talents . Your visitor , Mr. Hawking . Page 20/30 He would n't let me out of sight , not once . Scared that I might run amok , I think . Rules , rules , rules . Penrose lecture at London . Otherwise engaged ? Stephen ? You alright ? - Fine . Fine . - Oh , your two favourite words . - Is it alright for me to come ? - Fine . No it 's not your turn . What are you doing ? It 's in the rules , I 've croqueted you so I go again . - Can you keep doing that ? - Of course I can ! It 's what you 're supposed to do , get your opponent's ball as far away from yours as possible and then ... What ? What , it 's what you do in croquet ! Go on . The Penrose lecture at London , it 's alright . Go , now ! Work ! You all have big biceps . You 're right armed . Because you spend half of your lives scrawling tonnes of chalk dust , across miles of blackboard . I ... ... do n't do that . I have something magic and wonderful to tell you about . It 's fast , it 's rigorous , and you do n't need big muscles . It 's called topology . Pictures , not equations . And nothing moves faster than light . 186 000 miles a second , light is the fastest . Easily fast enought to overcome the gravity pull of , say , the Sun , or the Earth , and escape . The speed is high enough to get away from the gravity pulling it back . What if the Sun were more concentrated ? Page 21/30 What if the Sun were collapsing ? The density becomes huge , the gravity pull enormous . Now nothing can stop gravity pulling everything in . Even light . A singularity forms . What is a singularity ? A singularity is a place , where matter , light , space , - time - everything , fold in on themselves and disappear . It 's profound and total nothingness . Everything in nothing . Up until now all of you people , with your big biceps and your big equations have always said : `` Oh my big equation is ending in a singularity , I must be wrong ! '' It 's what frightened Einstein . Singularities ca n't exist because the laws of science do n't allow for them . - Wrong . Singularities do exist . - For perfect spheres , for idealised stars . No . For real stars . Real stars do it too ; singularities are out there . There are places were science and rules break down , where there is no matter , no space , nothing . Where everything , including time , does not exist . And when a star collapses , a singularity is inevitable . Topology does n't bother with the messy stuff , abot particles , and how they move , it 's about how things connect . - Big thinking . - Big bold thinking . It takes you into places where the rules say you ca n't go . And it 's fast . You say that it 's fast . I 've tried to be truthful with you . Page 22/30 I 'm not going to stop now . There 's nothing more we can do . There 's no treatment , Stephen . I 'm sorry . They 've washed their hands of him . - We 've got to carry on , Frank . - Carry on ? Carry on ? ! We have to do a lot more than carry on . Vitamin B , hydroxycobalamin , steroids . I have n't washed my hands of you , they 're wrong . You understand ? They 're wrong , the lot of them . You do n't ever talk about his illness . He does n't speak about it . We respect that , it 's simple , really . And what do you think of me ? I mean , what do you think I should do ? Sorry , no that 's not fair , do n't answer George . You probably think I should take myself of back to St. Albans and look for a nice husband . I think it 's terrific you do n't talk about his illness . The blue lights are picking up the fluorescence you get in washing powder , that is why their shirts are illuminated . - They 're very strange ! - The dresses are new . They have n't been washed , so they 're not fluorescent . There you are , you see ? Great scientist . I can tell you all about how washing powders react under blue light . One of the great questions of our time . Whether Tide or Daz is under blue lights ! Do you want to dance ? ! I do n't know what you should do . I know what you want . - House , garden , children , work . - A life together . The impossible . Page 23/30 I 've been thinking about Galileo and what you said about him frightening people . Imagine what if must have felt like to be told that the Sun did n't go round the Earth . Horrible ! Or that the Earth is n't flat . It is , is n't it ? Flat , Jane ? Do n't tell me it is n't flat . Oh no , oh no ! If you look me in the eye now and tell me it is n't flat , I do n't know what I do . I 'd be - inconsolable , totally desolate . Stephen ! Did you have any idea what it might be ? Did you think you knew ? Or was it just guessing ? Is that what you're trying to say ? A Nobel Prize for guess work ? Is that the story you 're after ? Let me tell you something . Are we still filming ? Good . In 1939 , my mother and father put me on a train filled with Jewish children heading to England . Kinder transport . Are you ok ? The Nazis were letting some children go . Not the adults , just some children . At the station my mother looked in to my face and said to me to look out for my little brother , not to let our suitcase out of my sight and do n't lose your name tag . Arno Penzias , here . You lose your name tag , you lose your name and you lose everything . - And she went . - How old were you ? - I was six . - Did you see her again ? I was six , my little brother was five . She did n't cry . She made like it was a normal thing , and not crying was part of that . Can you imagine how hard it must have been not to cry ? To put your boys on a train like that Page 24/30 and not to cry ? I 've hated suitcases ever since . He likes to unpack . My mother and my father got out . Six months later we sailed for America together . England saved my life . America gave me a brand new one . But I never , I never dreamed of this happening . We discovered this . We found this , we discovered this . What is it ? This clock . It was fine whe I got it . Then I went to America and it started to run backwards . Stops my student getting too complacent about the nature of time . - I do n't know why I came here , I was just ... - The music . - Bach did n't finish it . - He died before he finished it . But it 's so perfect . Everything he 's done before is so perfect . It does n't end . You can hear it after it stops . Listen . Can you hear it ? Can you hear it ? I 'll see you in Cambridge . - I thought that was us . - So did I . - But it was n't . - No , it was them . Backwards now . We are having a time of it ! It 's this platform , platform one . It 's never straightforward , you know . You do n't know what 's going to happen next . Sometimes I tell my husband about it , but he does n't listen . He just says , it 's platform one ! It 's a Cambridge platform , of course strange things are going to happen . It 's the platform for Cambridge . Nobody else knows it 's there Page 25/30 apart from ... - Cambridge types . - Backwards . Backwards ! -Yes dear . - You reverse time , of course ! - You reverse the direction of time . - Yes . - Are you a Cambridge type ? - Yes . And I love you deeply and forever . Roger ! Roger Penrose ! Stop ! - You all right ? - What would it all look like ? - What ? - What if Einstein was right ? ! - About what ? - Pencil ! And some paper ! Chalk . - Time-space diagram . What comes first ? - Space . Time ? You have to think about reversing the direction of time . Time going the other way . - What ? What for ? - Go on , do n't stop ! Go on ! - Now , the present us . - Here we are , looking back through time . - Light , dense matter , in space . - Warping space-time ? Causing the light rays , bending the light rays towards the centre . Look , the past is pear shaped . What are you saying ? What if the whole of the universe were trapped in a region whose boundaries reached to zero . A singularity , nothingness ? Your theory works for collapsing dying stars . It proves that a singularity must exist . What if it works for this ? Could it work Roger ? What would it mean if it did ? - A collapse in reverse . - Which is ? An explosion ! Page 26/30 Bang ! - Trinity Hall . - Sorry what ? - Trinity Hall ! - What are you saying ? Write it down . Why do n't you write it down ? - Trinity Hall ! - I 'm sorry mate . - Trinity Hall . - Oh , right ! What 's the matter with him ? - Have you heard of Bishop Usher ? - Seventeenth century . He calculated the date of the start of the universe . - How ? - By adding up all the ages of people in the Old Testament . - And how old is the universe ? - It started at some point at the night of 22nd October 4004 BC . - So old ! - So old . There 's something I want to ask you . Where was I going when I saw you at the station ? No ... Stephen ? - Are you all right ? - Fine . The thing is ... I was wondering ... ... whether you consider marrying me . - You probably want time to think about it . - I love you . Does that mean you 're about to say no ? Time . Time to think . - Stephen . - Not now , John . Think about time going in the opposite direction . What ? Singularities . A collapse , everything into nothing , yes ? So reverse the time , so the collapse is an explosion . Page 27/30 - Nothing into everything . - You 're talking stars . No , no , I 'm not talking about stars . I 'm talking about the beginning of the universe . That Roger Penrose . Clever of me to find him . - I told you you could help him . - He helped himself I think . - That 's your other talent . - What ? Preposterous modesty . There you are . Where have you been ? Dennis Sciama wants to see you . He semed very serious . The first three chapters ... ... nothing special . The fourth ... Mozart . Oh ! Hello . - Jane , women ware n't allowed . - No , not allowed . Against the rules ! I ... I 'll go . Hello . Goodbye . I , er ... I have to go and see the bursar at Caius . They 've given me a fellowship . Are you coming ? It 's the same rule for everyone at Caius . No special treatment when it comes to housing . - I 'm not like all the rest . - That 's what they all say . You listen to me . And listen very carefully . This man can not walk upstairs . His illness wo n't allow it and his illness will get worse . He needs housing with easy access and you are going to find it for him , because if you do n't all the newspapers will hear about how the bursar of this college treats a man of huge courage , a brilliant mind and a capacity to imagine faith like ... like a piece of nothing . Page 28/30 Do you understand me ? And he 's going to be my husband . What he 's done is to make Einstein work . He 's made Einstein ... There 's a word that physicists like to use very occasionally . `` Beautiful . '' He 's made Einstein beautiful . Yes but what ... What has he done ? Your son has opened up something which I thought , we all thought , was closed . Einstein appeared to be predicting it and then he turned away . There could have been a beginning . The universe ... ... may not always have been here . If you are right , which you are not , there should be some left over radiation from the Big Bang and somebody should have heard it . But they have n't , have they ? I wonder why that could be ? Could it be because it is n't there ? Where 's the fossil , Hawking ? Where 's the fossil ? We have to go . It connects , do you understand ? It goes right through Dachau . Right through childhood . Right through cockroaches and suitcases and right through America and the American dream , which I have lived . Do you understand me ? This noise ... ... this goddamn beautiful hiss ... ... it connects . It 's the sound of the beginning of time . The leftover heat from the Big Bang . The three degrees that has n't cooled yet . It 's everywhere . - It 's all around us . - It 's fifteen billion years old . - And we found it . - That 's our discovery . Page 29/30 We have to go get the prize , Arno . - What was there before the Big Bang ? - Whatever it was , it was n't time , or space , or matter . - There 's room for God . - Yes , in theory . So what now ? I 'm going to eat crme brulee and a huge number of chocolate truffles . And fight very hard to get you to see how wonderful Wagner is , and how Brahms is not so wonderful . I meant with work . A theory of everything . I have been looking at the very big , and now I want to look into very small , and see how one may unify gravity and quantum mechanics . - And how long might this theory of everything take ? - Twenty years , no more than that . - That fast ? - That fast . I belive in the possible . I believe , small though we are , insignificant though we may be , we can reach a full understanding of the universe . You were right when you said you felt small looking up at all that out there . We are very , very small , but we are profoundly capable of very , very big things . Where are you going ? Things to do . Can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? Page 30/30"

The story will be played for realistic comedy - which means the essentially truthful moods and attitudes will be portrayed accurately , with an occasional bizarre or super-realistic crescendo . The acting will never be so-called `` comedy '' acting . 2 . The sets and technical details will be done realistic- ally and carefully . We will strive for the maximum atmosphere and sense of visual reality from the sets and locations . 3 . The Flying sequences will especially be presented in as vivid a manner as possible . Exciting backgrounds and special effects will be obtained . 1 MAIN TITLE CARD - A WEIRD , HYDRA-HEADED , FURRY CREATURE SNARLS AT CAMERA ROLL-UP TITLE `` NARDAC BLEFESCU PRESENTS '' Dr. Strangelove : or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the BOMB a MACRO - GALAXY - METEOR PICTURE 1a MOVING SHOT - THROUGH BLACK , STARRY , PERPETUAL NIGHT OF THE UNIVERSE The motion is straight ahead ; passing at varying distances are stars , planets , asteroids , moons , aerolites and meteors . At great distances we see fantastic whirls of light indicating a vast nebula , or we see the incredible , dazzling billion-star clusters of another galaxy . MUSIC - WEIRD , EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL , ELECTRONIC SOUNDS NARRATOR The bizarre and often amusing pages which make up this odd story were dis- covered at the bottom of a deep crevice in the Great Northern Desert by members of our Earth Probe , Nimbus-II . NARRATOR Our story begins sometime during the latter half of Earth 's so-called Twentieth Century . Simple nuclear weapons had been invented , but used only twice to finish the so-called Second World War . The Earth appears ahead of us , continually growing to reveal the shape of its continents and oceans . NARRATOR We deal with the period following this , which was chiefly marked by the fact that though every nation feared surprise attack , the full consequences of nuclear weapons seemed to escape all governments and their people . The Earth is quite close now , its circumference almost filling the screen . NARRATOR The quirkish author of this ancient comedy seems intentionally to have omitted the names of specific countries , possibly in the hope it would land a certain Universality to his theme . Geographic details fill the screen . CUT TO 2 DAY - AIR SHOTS - B-90 STING RAY BOMBERS Magnificent , swept-wing , eight-jet , Mach 2 aircraft . NARRATOR In order to guard against surprise attack , the nation in question kept seventy-five B-90 Sting Ray bombers air-borne , twenty- four hours a day . They were armed with a full load of nuclear weapons . 2a DAY - B-90 's TAKING OFF NARRATOR As part of this air-borne alert , thirty-five B-90 Sting Ray bombers of the Air Command's 843rd Bomb Wing left the Burpelson Air Force Base , fourteen hours before . 3 B-90 STING RAYS - FLYING NARRATOR The aircraft were now dispersed from the Persian Gulf to the Arctic Ocean . They had only one geographical factor in common . They were all assigned targets inside enemy territory . 4 DAY - B-90 `` LEPER COLONY '' at 30,000 FEET NARRATOR One of the 843d 's aircraft , the `` Leper Colony , '' was approaching its Positive- Control point , Bear Island , a small dot in the Barents Sea , where it would turn around and head for home . 5 DOWN VIEW - STING RAY - FLYING SHOT NARRATOR Each Sting Ray carried a bomb load of fifty megatons , or fifty million tons of TNT , equal to fifteen times the total explosive force of World War Two , or twenty-five thousand times the explosive force of the Atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima . 6 REAR VIEW - STING RAY - FLYING SHOT NARRATOR The long , tense hours which always passed with such agonizing slowness during the twenty-four hours of an air-borne alert , now began to move quicker , as the mission passed its halfway mark . 7 FRONT VIEW - STING RAY - FLYING SHOT NARRATOR The crew of the `` Leper Colony '' knew they guarded the peace of the world just as surely as they knew the price they must pay within themselves to do it . 8 CU - MAJOR `` KING '' KONG - PILOT - INT . STING RAY He is a sharp-eyed , steady veteran flyer . CAMERA PULLS BACK showing MAJOR KONG , absorbed in a copy of `` Plaything '' magazine and absently munching a sandwich . We feature a photograph . PHOTOGRAPH - DOUBLE FOLD OF NUDE BLONDE Miss Milky Way , Plaything of the Month , a top government stenographer and part-time model . CAMERA PULLS BACK - CAPTAIN `` ACE '' ANGST showing CAPTAIN `` ACE '' ANGST , the co-pilot , reading another copy of `` Plaything '' and taking healthy bites out of an apple . He is a lean , bronzed , muscular type . The plane cruises on auto-pilot . 8a NAVIGATOR - LIEUTENANT `` BINKY '' BALLMUFF - READS `` PLAYTHING '' A burly , hoarse-voiced man in his early thirties , he sips coffee and chews on his sandwich . 8b RADIO-RADAR- LIEUTENANT TERRY TOEJAM - READS `` SUNSHINE AND LOVE '' A tall , curly-haired , meticulous man in his late twenties , he nibbles a piece of cake . 8c BOMBARDIER - LIEUTENANT LOTHAR ZOGG - A NEGRO A short , bull-necked man in his early thirties , smoking and dunking a cake . He reads `` Nitelife '' magazine . 8d D.S.O . - LIEUTENANT QUENTIN QUIFFER - READS `` HI-JINKS '' The Defense Systems Officer , LIEUTENANT QUENTIN QUIFFER , a blond , pleasant mid-Westerner . He eats chocolate crackers from a box . 8e NAVIGATOR - LIEUTENANT `` BINKY '' BALLMUFF He idly glances at his charts without putting down his copy of `` Plaything '' and snaps his intercom button . LIEUTENANT BALLMUFF Three minutes to turning point . Heading will be three-three-five . ( back to `` Plaything '' ) 8f MS - PILOT - MAJOR `` KING '' KONG He glances up from his copy of `` Plaything '' and with the easy grace of a veteran pilot , leans forward and changes his gyro heading . MAJOR KONG Roger . Heading three-three-five . ( back to `` Plaything '' ) 8g CU - RADARSCOPE There are a number of them . This one is the maximum search radar . The outer rim of the scope reveals a small point of light . At the same moment an electronic tone alarm directs the attention of the D.S.O . from his reading to the scope . 8h CU - D.S.O . LIEUTENANT QUENTIN QUIFFER LOOKING UP FROM `` HI-JINKS '' He studies the scope calmly and frowns . 8i CU - RADARSCOPE The D.S.O . moves a strobe marker to the blip . 8j CU - D.S.O . Quickly figuring on pad . LIEUTENANT QUIFFER ( routinely ) Bogey at one-four-five , approximately a hundred and thirty-five miles . 8k CU - NAVIGATOR - LIEUTENANT `` BINKY '' BALLMUFF Turning his copy of `` Plaything '' over so as not to lose his place , plots a position . We see that the radar contact is between the `` Leper Colony '' and the enemy coast . LIEUTENANT BALLMUFF Probably another radar surveillance job . 8l CU - PILOT Without looking up from his copy of `` Plaything '' . MAJOR KONG ( absently ) Yes , that 's probably what it is . 8m CLOSE RADARSCOPE The blip suddenly vanishes as the scope goes completely white . LIEUTENANT QUIFFER ( calmly ) He 's showing off his ECM - jamming us out . MAJOR KONG ( still absorbed in `` Plaything '' ) I wonder why he 's doing that ? LIEUTENANT QUIFFER I was thinking the same thing . Shall I give him a taste of ours ? MAJOR KONG ( still reading ) Why should we do that , Quentin ? LIEUTENANT QUIFFER ( goes back to `` Plaything '' ) Yes , I suppose you 're right , King . 8n CU - THE CRM - 114 This is the most highly guarded Air Command secret device . It is an automatic code receiver which displays three letters and three numerals . It suddenly whirrs and clicks into life , displaying three letters and three numerals . 8o CU - LIEUTENANT TERRY TOEJAM Looks up slowly from his magazine , leans forward and jots down the coded message . He carefully flips through a code book . LIEUTENANT TOEJAM Major Kong , we got a message from base . 8p CU - PILOT MAJOR KONG ( still reading ) Good . 8q MS - LIEUTENANT TOEJAM RAPIDLY DECODES THE MESSAGE LIEUTENANT TOEJAM I 've decoded it , Major Kong . MAJOR KONG Good . LIEUTENANT TOEJAM It reads : Wing to hold at X-points . 8r CUTS TO CREW The magazines are lowered in slow motion . 8s CU - BOMBARDIER - LIEUTENANT LOTHAR ZOGG LIEUTENANT ZOGG ( into intercom ) I wonder why the 're doing that . 8t CU - PILOT - MAJOR `` KING '' KONG MAJOR KONG ( wisely ) They have their reasons . 8u CU - NAVIGATOR - LIEUTENANT `` BINKY '' BALLMUFF LIEUTENANT BALLMUFF But we 've been up fourteen hours . I'm beat . 8v CUTS TO CREW Who mumble ad-libs of agreement with the Navigator . Then slowly , each man goes back to his magazine and his lunch . 8w CU - LIEUTENANT LOTHAR ZOGG - READING LIEUTENANT ZOGG ( sighing ) Probably an exercise . LIEUTENANT TOEJAM ( reading ) Probably . MAJOR KONG ( reading ) They have their reasons . VARIOUS CUTS And now the six-man crew is still again , pondering the mysteries of beautiful women and calmly digesting their lunch . MAJOR KONG ( wistfully to co-pilot ) Ace , do you think she 's really a top government secretary ? He refers to the double fold-out of Miss Milky Way . CAPTAIN `` ACE '' ANGST ( cynically ) Yeah , I 'll bet she holds the world's horizontal short-hand record . SUPERIMPOSE TITLE : `` BURPELSON AIR FORCE BASE HEADQUARTERS 843rd BOMB WING '' 9 NIGHT - EXT . MOONLIT VIEWS OF BASE - VARIOUS CUTS While the Wing is air-borne , the staff work is heavy , and the ground crews work overtime to refit aircraft . The runways are clear , and only the giant cicadas and the occasional whine of an electric tool break the stillness of the starry desert night . 10 INT . BASE COMBAT OPERATIONS CENTER It is sunken fifty feet below the administration building . Six officers man the command bridge . A loud buzzer . MAJOR MANDRAKE lifts special phone . MAJOR MANDRAKE Combat Operations Center , Major Mandrake speaking . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER This is General Ripper speaking . MAJOR MANDRAKE Yes , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Do you recognize my voice ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Certainly , General . Why do you ask , sir ? 11 INT . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER 'S OFFICE Large , plush , part Air Force , part big executive - swank office decorations and furniture . A name-plate on his desk reads , `` General Jack D. Ripper '' . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER ( sharply ) Why do you think I ask ? MAJOR MANDRAKE I do n't know , sir . We just spoke a few minutes ago . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER ( ruffled ) Youddo n't think I 'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important , do you , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE No , sir . The scene will intercut between MANDRAKE and RIPPER . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Good . Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Yes , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER All right , Major . I 'm putting the base on condition Red . MAJOR MANDRAKE Condition Red ! GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER That 's right . I want this flashed to all section immediately . MAJOR MANDRAKE Yes , sir . What 's up , General Ripper ? A significant pause . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER You 're a good officer , Major Mandrake . You have a right to know . It looks like we 're in a shooting war ! MAJOR MANDRAKE A shooting war ! GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Yes , Major . This looks like it 's going to be it . MAJOR MANDRAKE But ... what kind of a shooting war ? Have they hit any of our cities yet ? GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Major , that 's all I 've been told . Just got it on the red phone . The base is to be sealed tight . And I mean tight . MAJOR MANDRAKE Yes , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER . That includes all communications and phones - incoming as well as outgoing . MAJOR MANDRAKE What if someone wants to call us ? GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Let me worry about that , Major . I 've still got my red line to the Air Command . MAJOR MANDRAKE That 's right , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER We do n't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down , do we ? MAJOR MANDRAKE You 're right , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER No calls from inside out . No calls from outside in are even answered . No calls . MAJOR MANDRAKE I understand , sir . Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER ( harshly ) No calls at all . With or without my say-so . My voice can be imitated too , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE Yes , sir . I just thought of something , sir . How do I know I 'm talking to you now ? GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Who do you think you 're talking to ? MAJOR MANDRAKE To you , sir . But how do I know ? GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Are you trying to be insubordinate ? MAJOR MANDRAKE No , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER I hope not . Now , as soon as you do what I told you , have Plan-R radioed to the Wing . MAJOR MANDRAKE Plan-R ? ? ? ? GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Are you hard of hearing , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE No , sir . Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER As soon as you 've done that , shut down the communications center . Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details . MAJOR MANDRAKE General Ripper , if I shut down the communi- cations center , there 'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone , for that matter . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Are you questioning my orders , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE No , sir . I 'm just bringing the facts to your attention , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER You 're a good officer , Major , and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention . MAJOR MANDRAKE Thank you , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER Now , as soon as you 've done that , double- up on all base security teams . Our enemies are plenty smart , and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs . MAJOR MANDRAKE Yes , sir . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER And lastly , all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded . They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs . Air Police will have lists of all owners . 12 DAY - AIR SHOT - B-90 `` LEPER COLONY '' 13 DAY - INT . B-90 - VARIOUS CUTS The crew is still wistfully absorbed in their magazines . 13a CU - CRM-114 It whirrs to life again . Clicking off three letters and three numerals . 13b CU - LT. TOEJAM - RADIO He idly glances up at it . Sighs , reaches for his code book and starts decoding . He frowns . LT. TOEJAM Hey , King . Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor . MAJOR KONG ( reading ) Yeah ? LT. TOEJAM I just got another blast on the CRM-114 , and the damned thing decodes : Wing Attack , Plan-R. 13c CU - PILOT - MAJOR `` KING '' KONG He looks up pensively . MAJOR KONG Wing attack , Plan-R ? 13d MASTER SHOT LT. TOEJAM Wing attack , Plan-R. That 's exactly what it says . MAJOR KONG ( lets magazine fall in lap ) Check your code again . No one at base would pull a stunt like that , Terry . LT. TOEJAM That 's what I 'm doing , and it comes out the same . There is a pause as they think of the unthinkable . LT. `` BINKY '' BALLMUFF ( standing ) You must have made a mistake . LT. TOEJAM That 's what it decodes . Come and see for yourself , Binky . Wing attack , Plan-R . The whole crew comes up and hunches over the CRM-114 . The plane cruises on auto-pilot . LT. LOTHAR ZOGG ( softly ) Well , I 'll be damned . LT. TOEJAM ( holding out code book to pilot ) Here , check it yourself . 13e CU - MAJOR KONG His cheek muscles twitch under his bronzed face . He is the picture of leadership . He turns away from the men for a moment , stares thoughtfully into space , then turns back determinedly . MAJOR KONG ( with quiet dignity ) Then this is it . LT. QUIFFER What ? MAJOR KONG ( solemnly ) War . LT. QUIFFER ( awe-struck ) War ? CAPTAIN ANGST ( nodding gravely ) Yes , that must be what it is . LT. BALLMUFF ( aghast ) War ? LT. ZOGG ( stunned ) What else could it be ? LT. QUIFFER Maybe it 's an exercise . LT. BALLMUFF Yeah , to see if we 're on our toes . MAJOR KONG ( wisely ) No , they would n't send us in with bombs on an exercise . LT. QUIFFER Maybe they want to test our loyalty . CAPTAIN ANGST But we got the Go-code . It 's never been given to anyone before . MAJOR KONG ( scowling ) No , this looks like the real thing . LT. TOEJAM ( philosophically ) Yeah , it sure looks like the real thing , all right . They all soberly reflect on the wider implications of the news . The BOMBARDIER cracks his knuckles . LT. ZOGG ( shaking his head ) It 's going to be rough on the folks back home . LT. BALLMUFF Yeah - real rough . They all shake their heads in melancholy agreement . LT. TOEJAM I wonder how it started ? CAPTAIN ANGST Yes , how could it have started ? THE D.S.O . shatter the calm dignity of the crew by raising his voice . LT. QUIFFER The bastards must have hit us ! LT. BALLMUFF Yeah - but why would they do that , Quentin ? LT. QUIFFER How do I know ? But they must have . We would n't have started it . LT. ZOGG He 's right . We would n't have started it . LT. QUIFFER ( beginning to shout ) They must have clobbered some of our cities already ! LT. ZOGG He 's right . They must have clobbered some of our cities already . LT. QUIFFER The dirty , stinking , rotten , sons of B 's ! ! They might have clobbered Marge and the LT. QUIFFER ( cont ) kids already ! 13f CU - MAJOR KONG He studies LT. QUIFFER with a jaundiced look . MAJOR KONG ( John Wayne ) Okay , cut it , Lieutenant Quiffer ! If you speak once more before I give you per- mission , you 'll face a general court martial when we get back . ( looks around ) And that goes for everyone else . He pauses for effect . 13g CU - D.S.O . LIEUTENANT QUENTIN QUIFFER looks down sheepishly . 13h CU - MAJOR KONG MAJOR KONG ( John Wayne ) Boys , we 've got a mission to carry out . It 's not exactly a pleasant one , but our country 's counting on us , and we 're not going to let 'em down . 13i FULL SHOT - THE CREW LT. QUIFFER I 'm sorry , Major Kong . I guess I was way out of line . MAJOR KONG ( extending his hand ) Forget it , Quentin . It can happen to the best of us . Now let 's get squared away . With various ad libs of agreement , the crew scramble back to their action stations . 13j VARIOUS SHOTS - CREW LIEUTENANT BALLMUFF opens a small safe and searches out a thick 8 x 10 sealed envelope marked `` Plan-R '' , from among a dozen others . He shoots an inquiring look to the pilot and gets a nod . He breaks open the seal and distributes individual folders to each of the crew . MAJOR KONG Give me a first rough course as soon as you can , Lieutenant Ballmuff . LT. BALLMUFF Roughly , one-zero-five . I 'll have it plotted in a minute , Major Kong . 13k MS - MAJOR KONG He adjusts the gyro , banks the big plane , and opens his folder . MAJOR KONG ( reading from his folder ) Okay . Check these points . Complete radio silence . To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders , the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits . The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114 , which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters . You got it ? LT. TOEJAM Roger , I 'm setting up the CRM-114 . MAJOR KONG Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa . One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand . Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions . Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak . Fused air burst at ten thousand . LT. BALLMUFF I 've got the heading , Major . One-three-eight . MAJOR KONG Roger . One-three-eight . While he talks , other CUTS to the crew prepraring for battle . MAJOR KONG In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar . Cross in over the coast low-level , continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary , and climb for bomb run . ( pause ) Any questions ? LT. ZOGG I 've got one . MAJOR KONG Shoot , Lothar . LT. ZOGG Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities , right ? MAJOR KONG That 's what I said . LT. ZOGG Well , if there 's a war , they must have hit us first . MAJOR KONG What 's your point , Lothar ? LT. ZOGG Well , if they hit us first , they 've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already . We 'll just be hitting empty real estate . MAJOR KONG Are you saying our order do n't make sense ? LT. ZOGG Hellnno , Major . I was just trying to think the thing through . MAJOR `` KING '' KONG Lothar , you 're down in the pay books as a bombardier , and you 're a damned good bombardier . In fact , you 're the best damned bombardier in 843rd Wing . 14 15 15a COLONEL PUNTRICH He sits at a table a phone . Six other officers are around him . COLONEL PUNTRICH Hello ? This is Colonel Puntrich of Air Command Headquarters . Please connect me with General `` Buck '' Schmuck . 16 NIGHT - EXT .

General Schmuck is asleep and he is n't taking calls until eight-thirty . COLONEL PUNTRICH What is your name , young lady ? SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR Ceida Pietraszkiewicz .

COLONEL PUNTRICH ( he pronounces it perfectly ) Now look here , Miss Pietraszkiewicz , this is Air Command Headquarters calling . DISSOLVE 18 OMITTED 19 NIGHT - INT . HOTEL ROOM - GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Phone rings . He wakes slowly , coughing from too many cigarettes . He snaps on the bed lamp and picks up the phone . The night table contains tissues , nose drops , and a glass of water . There is a pretty blonde asleep in the next bed , Miss Milky Way , Plaything of the Month ! GENERAL SCHMUCK ( angrily ) Yes ! COLONEL PUNTRICH General Schmuck ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Yes ! Who the hell is this ? Miss MILKY WAY , about nineteen , appears from under the blankets of the adjoining twin bed . She yawns and stretches , revealing her astonishing body . She is indeed the same girl we saw featured in the `` Plaything '' fold-out-inside the B-90 . COLONEL PUNTRICH This is Colonel Puntrich , sir . Duty officer at Air Command . I 'm sorry to disturb you , sir . MILKY WAY ( yawning ) Who is it , Buck , honey ? GENERAL SCHMUCK ( covering mouthpiece ) Go back to sleep , baby . COLONEL PUNTRICH What did you say , sir ? She smiles , crosses over next to the General , and begins playing with his ear . He shrugs her off , playfully . GENERAL SCHMUCK I did n't say anything . What 's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour , Colonel ? COLONEL PUNTRICH General Schmuck , we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base , HQ 843rd Wing . It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert . It decoded as - Wing attack , Plan-R. She begins kissing his neck . GENERAL SCHMUCK Colonel , you 're not drunk , are you , man ? COLONEL PUNTRICH No , sir . GENERAL SCHMUCK Then why bother me with this nonsense ? Get in touch with the base commander . She pulls him flat on the bed . COLONEL PUNTRICH We tried to contact General Jack D. Ripper at the base , but all their communications are dead , sir . She sprawls on top of him . GENERAL SCHMUCK Well , that 's ridiculous . If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order , just pick up a phone and pay for a call . COLONEL PUNTRICH I know it sounds crazy , sir , but we tried , and nobody answers any of the telephones . GENERAL SCHMUCK sits up . GENERAL SCHMUCK Does the threat board show anything ? COLONEL PUNTRICH Well , that 's the funny part of it , too , sir . It does n't show a damned thing . 20 NIGHT - EXT . LONG SHOT - BURPELSON AIR FORCE BASE Buttoning-up activity continues as the men listen to the GENERAL 's broadcast echoing on a public address system . GENERAL RIPPER ( public address system ) I want to impress on you the need for watchfulness .

GENERAL RIPPER 'S OFFICE GENERAL RIPPER Well , you can be sure other men are defending your families elsewhere with the same unyielding spirit we 're going to show here at Burpelson . Good luck to you all . RIPPER flicks the mike button and sinks wearily back into his chair . He lights a cigarette and inhales with satisfaction . 26 INT . COMMUNICATIONS SECTION - MAJOR MANDRAKE Snaps off his desk lamp and walks down the long , deserted room , double-clicking various power switches . He picks up a small transistor radio and idly snaps it on . A pop song ends and a disc jockey begins his commercial . 26a CLOSE - MAJOR MANDRAKE He tunes in a few other stations . All programs are normal . MANDRAKE frowns , thinks for a moment , and suddenly dashes out of the room . 27 NIGHT - EXT .

Rising around a very large , polished wood conference table are the Chiefs of Staff , Army , Navy , and Air Force , as well as various military and civilian senior aides - about twenty altogether . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( seething ) Good morning , gentlemen . Please sit down . They sit . There are readable nameplates in front of each officer . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Good morning , Mister President . The PRESIDENT scowls . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Now , what the hell 's going on ? Four-Star Air Force General , `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK , stands and assumes his maximum dignity . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Well , Mister President . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY What kind of trouble ? GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Well , sir , about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders , General Jack D. Ripper , sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing , under his command . Note : 1 . The name Schmuck appears on page 1431 of the 1961-62 Manhattan Telephone Directory . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General Schmuck ? GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Yes , sir . He issued attack orders to -- A paroxysm of rage seizes the President , MERKIN MUFFLEY , as he pounds his fist on the table , knocking over his nameplate . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ? ? ? GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK To be perfectly honest , Mister President , we really are n't sure . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY You are n't sure ! GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Not exactly , sir . You see , Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago . He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order , and General Ripper said : ( he reads from a piece of paper ) `` Sure , the orders came from me . They're on their way in , and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them . My boys will give you the best kind of start , and you sure as hell wo n't stop them now . '' Then he hung up . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Damn it ! Damn it ! I 've been telling you all for years you 've got too damned many psychoes in the service . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Be fair , Mister President . Did n't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Buck , when I told you to give them right up to the top , you said we could n't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he 's a psycho . GENERAL SCHMUCK It was a honest mistake , sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY I presume the planes are armed ? GENERAL SCHMUCK I 'm afraid so , Mister Presient . Being part of the air-borne alert , each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Well , what about the Positive Control , the safety catch ? Do n't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order ? GENERAL SCHMUCK That 's right , sir . But the planes were at their Positive Control points , ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY And I suppose there 's some reason why you have n't recalled them ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Yes , sir . The base commander , General Ripper , selected Plan-R ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY What the hell is Plan-R ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Well , sir , Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Why ca n't you cancel it ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Once the orders have been given , Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft . But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY And I suppose you 're going to tell me you do n't know what the three-letter code is . GENERAL SCHMUCK Mister President , to guard against espionage , the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself , just before each mission . They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy . In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing , and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes . The PRESIDENT shakes his head , wrathfully . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY How soon until the enemy finds out what 's going on ? GENERAL SCHMUCK We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY How could you let this happen , General Schmuck ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Mister President , I know you think I 've let you down , but we had to have a Plan-R . If we completely centralized the command and control , all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol , and we 'd be out of business . We 'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Then there 's no chance for recall ? GENERAL SCHMUCK I should say practically none , though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination . The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations , and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all . There is a knock at the door . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Yes , what is it ? M.P . CAPTAIN Excuse me , sir . But the mess orderlies are outside with the breakfasts everyone ordered . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( waspishly ) Captain , do you think the mess orderlies would mind waiting a few minutes until we have finished our little meeting ? M.P . CAPTAIN ( confused ) No , sir ... I mean , yes , sir . I 'm sure they would n't . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( shouts ) Thank you , Captain . Now shut the damned door ! He shuts the door . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( Cont ) I want to talk to the base commander , what 's his name ? GENERAL SCHMUCK General Jack D. Ripper , sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY I want to talk to General Ripper . GENERAL SCHMUCK But we ca n't communicate with the base . The PRESIDENT leans back and thinks for a moment . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General Faceman , are there any troops stationed near the base who are not under General Ripper's command ? All eyes go to GENERAL `` FLASH '' FACEMAN , the Army Chief . GENERAL `` FLASH '' FACEMAN I believe so , Mister President . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( in burning sarcasm ) Is it possible for you to know definitely , General ? GENERAL `` FLASH '' FACEMAN Yes , sir . I can confirm it , but I believe there 's a Special Services outfit stationed just on the other side of town , about seven miles away . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General Faceman , I want you to get on the phone yourself and speak to the officer in charge -- GENERAL FACEMAN Yes , sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( rapid fire ) Please do n't say `` yes , sir '' until I 've finished speaking . Tell him to get himself and his men moving immediately . I do n't even want them to waste time dressing . Just have them carry their weapons and ammunition , and move 'em out by any available means of transportation . If they do n't have enough vehicles , commandeer cars off the highway . I want them there within fifteen minutes . And if he ca n't get them all there , get as many as he can . I want them to enter the base , locate General Ripper , and immediately put him in telephone contact with me . You understand , do n't you , General ? GENERAL FACEMAN ( starts out of room ) Yes , sir . One thing , Mister President . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Yes ? GENERAL FACEMAN Under a condition red alert , the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY I am aware of what a condition red alert implies . GENERAL FACEMAN Well , sir , they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( sarcastically ) That 's a very wise deduction , General . GENERAL FACEMAN Thank you , sir . But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance ? The PRESIDENT rocks in his chair looking as if he were about to explode . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Under the circumstances , General , what would you think they should do ? GENERAL FACEMAN Well ... I suppose penetrate the base by force . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY You see , you knew the answer all the time , General . GENERAL FACEMAN But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt , Mister President . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper 's planes start bombing their targets ? GENERAL FACEMAN That certainly would be a problem , sir . CADAVERLY Mister President , how do you feel about Civil Defense ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Civil Defense ... Hm-mmm ... We don't want to cause an unnecessary panic . CADAVERLY Shall we allow the situation to mature a bit , sir ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Yes , I think that 's the wisest policy for the moment . 31 EXT . FLYING SHOT - B-90 STING RAY Tilting down toward the sea . 32 INT . B-90 LT. BALLMUFF ( navigator ) Make rate of descent fifteen hundred per minute . That should slide us in nicely under their radar cover . MAJOR KONG adjusts trim , throttling back slightly to maintain correct speed . We see the rate of descent indicator steady at 1500 , speed steady at Mach one-three on the Machmeter . MAJOR KONG Steady at fifteen hundred per minute . Speed steady at Mach one-three . The navigator , LT. BALLMUFF , glances at his Ground Position Indicator , on which certain of the pilot 's instruments are duplicated . LT. BALLMUFF Roger , maintain . MAJOR KONG Lothar , take your checks now . LT. ZOGG Okay , Major . LT. ZOGG , the Negro bombardier , is sitting in the midst of his equipment , which comprises several radioscopes and a battery of buttons and switch gear , as well as several banked rows of lights . He goes through the checks quickly , at ease wit the familiar equipment and a familiar task . LT. ZOGG Main search radar all green . Set for maximum range , maximum sweep . Again CUT between the pilot and bombardier , as bombardier calls each piece of equipment in turn , and pilot checks them on his list . LT. ZOGG Both electronic detectors set to swing from stud A through H. We see , on the bulky electronic detector , a small rotor arm moving rapidly through the sequence of stud settings , and flicking back to start again . MAJOR KONG A through H is correct . LT. QUIFFER ( D.S.O . ) Main interference linked to electronic detector . Fight interference on readi- ness state . MAJOR KONG Check . LT. QUIFFER Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens . We see the four lights winking on an off in rotation on the computer . MAJOR KONG Check . LT. QUIFFER Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary . LT. ZOGG Target approach radar tuning is right . All approach transparencies are checked , one through twenty-five . We see bombardier take one of the transparencies , slide it over approach radarscope . MAJOR KONG Check target approach . LT. ZOGG Bomb doors circuit is green , bomb release circuit is green , bomb fusing circuit is green . MAJOR KONG Check , all bomb circuits green . Okay , Lothar . LT. ZOGG When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary , Major ? MAJOR KONG As soon as I 've checked over the route . About five minutes . All right ? LT. BALLMUFF In thirty seconds count-down clock should read eight-three minutes , King . 32a COUNT-DOWN CLOCK Pilot 's hand sets clock to `` 83 '' 33 DAWN - LS - BURPELSON AIR FORCE BASE All the security details are in position , and everything is covered by a peaceful hush . 34 CU - GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER POINTING A 45 AUTOMATIC - INT . HIS OFFICE He gestures with the gun in a weirdly amiable way . GENERAL RIPPER Sit down , Major Mandrake . 34a MASTER SHOT MAJOR MANDRAKE closes the door behind him and sits . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( smiling nervously ) What 's the gun for , General Ripper ? GENERAL RIPPER Please do n't take any notice of this weapon , Major . I love all weapons , and as of late , I 've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( laughs shakily ) Sort of like a new hobby , huh , General ? GENERAL RIPPER That 's right , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE still holds the little transistor radio which softly plays a rock and roll tune . He smiles , idiotically . GENERAL RIPPER ( softly ) I see you 're playing your radio , Major . Is n't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Oh , it 's not my radio , sir . I picked it up in the communications center . GENERAL RIPPER I did n't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE Yes , sir . General , can I ask a question ? GENERAL RIPPER Certainly , Major Mandrake . You 're a good officer , and you can ask me a question any time you want to . MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , General Ripper , sir -- I was thinking -- we 're on a condition red , are n't we ? GENERAL RIPPER That is correct , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE And a condition red means enemy attack in progress , does n't it ? GENERAL RIPPER You know the regulations well , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , sir , I was thinking , if an enemy attack is in progress , how come the radio's still playing music ? It 's supposed to go off , and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts . GENERAL RIPPER That 's a good question , Major . Maybe if you think hard , you can think of the answer yourself . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( timidly ) Well , I was thinking , maybe an enemy attack is not in progress ? GENERAL RIPPER And if that were true ? MAJOR MANDRAKE wrinkles his forehead apprehensively . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( cautiously ) But then , sir , why have you issued the order : Wing attack , Plan-R ? GENERAL RIPPER Because I thought it proper , Major . Why else would you think I 'd do it ? 34b CU - MAJOR MANDRAKE - AS THE FULL TRUTH SINKS IN MAJOR MANDRAKE You mean you are ... starting ... the War , sir ? 34c MASTER SHOT GENERAL RIPPER Suppose that were the case ? MAJOR MANDRAKE ( awe-struck ) But -- why ... that would be an awful thing to do , sir . GENERAL RIPPER Perhaps , Major . Perhaps . Pour me a scotch and soda , please . And help yourself to whatever you like . MAJOR MANDRAKE rises unsteadily and goes to the built-in wall bar . GENERAL RIPPER Do n't fret about it , Major . There 's nothing anyone can do about it now . I 'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114 . MAJOR MANDRAKE I know that , sir . GENERAL RIPPER We 've come a long way since World War II , Major . And the lessons we 've learned are all in Plan-R. MANDRAKE 's hands tremble as he pours the drinks . MAJOR MANDRAKE I suppose they are , sir . GENERAL RIPPER You 're damned right they are . MAJOR MANDRAKE How much soda , sir . GENERAL RIPPER Just a squirt . He gives a squirt . MAJOR MANDRAKE That about right ? GENERAL RIPPER ( accepting drink ) Perfect . Thank you , Major . And now let 's drink a toast . MAJOR MANDRAKE pours himself a big slug and keeps it straight . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( raising his glass ) What shall we drink to , sir ? GENERAL RIPPER ( with the eyes of a zealot ) To peace on earth . They touch glasses . MAJOR MANDRAKE General Ripper , can I ask another question ? GENERAL RIPPER Ask away , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , General -- I was wondering , why are you doing this ? I mean why do you want to start the war ? GENERAL RIPPER I 've given it alot of thought , Major . Don't think I have n't . MAJOR MANDRAKE No , sir . I mean I did n't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought . GENERAL RIPPER Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war ? MAJOR MANDRAKE I do n't think so , sir . GENERAL RIPPER He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals . MAJOR MANDRAKE I see . GENERAL RIPPER When he said it , fifty years ago , he might have been right . But today , war is too important to be left to the politicians . Do you follow me , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE I 'm trying to , sir . GENERAL RIPPER You see , Major , at this very moment , while we sit and chat , a decision is being made by the President in the War Room . He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes . MAJOR MANDRAKE But when they do , sir , wo n't they hit back with everything they 've got ? GENERAL RIPPER If we have n't taken any further action , they certainly will . Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , I think I remember reading the report on that . Was n't it something like a hundred and sixty million ? GENERAL RIPPER That 's close enough , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people , sir ? GENERAL RIPPER You 're being dense , Major . I certainly don't GENERAL RIPPER ( Cont ) want to kill so many of our people . And neither does the President . Now look , Major Mandrake . What happens if the President immediately orders our entire missile force to hit enemy airfields , missiles and bases ? MAJOR MANDRAKE I suppose we might catch them off their guard . GENERAL RIPPER Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy , wouldn't they ? MAJOR MANDRAKE I guess so . GENERAL RIPPER I know so , Major . I know so . And add to that , the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they 've got . MAJOR MANDRAKE But even then , we would n't get everything . I mean some missiles would abort , or they 'd miss their targets , or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we do n't know about . GENERAL RIPPER You 're absolutely right . You forgot to mention their nuclear subs . But it would n't matter . Sure we would n't get off without getting our hair mussed , but we 'd prevail . I do n't think we 'd lose more than fifty million people , tops . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( hesitatingly ) But if you just let things alone , we wouldn't lose anyone . GENERAL RIPPER Major Mandrake , I guess you do n't follow what's going on too closely , do you ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Where , sir ? GENERAL RIPPER ( smiles patronisingly ) Where ? Everywhere , Major . Everywhere . MAJOR MANDRAKE nods , blankly . GENERAL RIPPER ( Cont ) Have you read much about the disarmament talks , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , I know they 've been going on for years , and they have n't gotten any place . GENERAL RIPPER Not yet , Major . Not yet . MAJOR MANDRAKE And I guess they wo n't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country . GENERAL RIPPER You 're very naive , Major . Do n't they say they want disarmament ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Yes , sir . But so do we . GENERAL RIPPER But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country . Are they a peace-loving country , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE I do n't know , sir . But they 're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are . War just does n't make sense any more , for anybody . GENERAL RIPPER But war does n't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Right . GENERAL RIPPER ( the prosecutor makes his point ) Then do n't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War ? And , if that 's the case , I ask you again : Why do they want disarmament ? MAJOR MANDRAKE ( despairing ) Well , sir , like I said , for the same reasons we do . I mean , all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident , or a mistake , or by some mentally unbalanced person -- ( lets his voice trail off ) MANDRAKE 's discretion was unnecessary for it would never occur to GENERAL RIPPER that anyone would think him mentally unbalanced . GENERAL RIPPER Go on , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( gaining confidence ) I was just going to say , as long as the weapons exist , sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that 'll be it for both countries . GENERAL RIPPER I 've heard the arguments . Like Napoleon's quote , `` There 's one thing you ca n't do with a bayonet , and that 's - sit on it . '' MAJOR MANDRAKE That 's right , sir . And do n't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb . What if they start something ? GENERAL RIPPER Go on , Major . You fascinate me . MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , sir , I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99 % of the days of the year , given average luck it would fail in thirty years . MAJOR MANDRAKE pauses to look for daylight . RIPPER returns his gaze , steadily . GENERAL RIPPER I still ask , why do they want disarmament ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , for the same reasons we do , sir . Do n't you see ? GENERAL RIPPER No , Major , I do n't . They have no regard for human life . They would n't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won . MAJOR MANDRAKE Gee , sir , that last remark does n't exactly make all the sense in the world . GENERAL RIPPER ( angrily ) Major , you 're talking like one of them ! MAJOR MANDRAKE ( shook ) Well , I 'm not , sir . Honestly , sir . GENERAL RIPPER Do n't be offended , Major . Our President holds the same views . MAJOR MANDRAKE Do n't you think he knows something about this , General Ripper ? GENERAL RIPPER I 'll tell you what I do think . If they say they 're for disarmament , I say anyone who says they 're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool . MAJOR MANDRAKE But , General , we 're on our toes . We haven't agreed to anything for years . Inffact , a a lot of people say we never will . GENERAL RIPPER But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want , we 'd agree , wouldn't we ? MAJOR MANDRAKE If they gave us what we think we need , yes , I guess we would . GENERAL RIPPER And you 'd like to see that ? MAJOR MANDRAKE General , what 's good enough for the President and all the experts he 's got working on the thing , is good enough for me . GENERAL RIPPER Do you think we 'd cheat ? MAJOR MANDRAKE No , sir . I 'm sure we would n't . GENERAL RIPPER Do you think they would cheat ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Look , sir . I 'm no expert on the subject , but I 've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have . Like , say , both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors . You ca n't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it . And if I were going to try and hide a few , I would n't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob is n't going to run and blab for a million bucks . We 're as smart as they are , and if they cheat , or even hold back information , we 'd pull right out . GENERAL RIPPER ( shaking his head ) Major , I hate to say this , but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated , and you do n't even know it . 35 DAWN - EXT . GOVERNEMT BUILDING 36 INT . WAR ROOM - COMMAND BRIDGE Air Force General `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK is speaking as the scene opens . The huge , polished wood table is neatly spread with the remains of breakfast . Eggs and bacon , melon , toast , silver thermos jugs of coffee , pastries , and glasses of ice water . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK In conclusion , I should like to observe that : One , our hopes for recalling the 843rd Bomb Wing are next to nothing . Two , in about fifteen minutes the enemy will be making radar contacts with our planes . Three , when they do , they will go absolutely Ape , and strike back with everything they 've got . Four , if prior to this we have n't done anything to suppress their retaliatory abilities , we will suffer virtual annihilation - in round numbers a hundred and fifty million killed . Five , if we immediately launch an all-out missile attack on their bases , we stand an excellent chance of catching them off guard . In that event , we will destroy the bulk of their retaliatory strength , prevail in the struggle , and suffer relatively modest and acceptable civilian casualties . He pauses and confidently looks around the table . The PRESIDENT stares at him inscrutably . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK If I may , I 'd like to illustrate my conclusion with a very brief story . ( a squinty-eyed smile ) I played guard on my high-school football team . I was n't particularly big for the line , and my coach once told me something I 've never for- gotten . `` Schmucko '' he said - that was what they called me in those days - `` Schmucko , always remember this . The harder you hit the other fellow , the less you 'll get hurt . '' ( confidently checks each game ) My recommendation is that we follow General Ripper 's action to its logical end . In other words , to hit the other fellow as hard as we can ! No one says anything . ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE What 's your estimate of casualties if we strike first ? ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE is a model of the crisp , tough Navy man . His lean , rugged features are lit by an obvious intelligence . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Under those circumstances , oh , I 'd say for us twenty to fifty million , depending on the breaks . For the enemy , something on the order of fifty million , if we stick to military targets . ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE You are very casual about those figures , General Schmuck . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Not at all , Admiral Buldike . Naturally , we all deeply regret such a sad loss - and let me be the first to say , I do n't like the idea one bit that we 'd be clobbering their women and children . But quit a few of their bases are very close to cities and towns , and to would be unavoidable . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Well , gentlemen , do you concur with General Schmuck ? There is a nervous silence . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Mister President , regretable as such a choice is , there is a quantitative difference between fifty and a hundred and fifty million of our dead . PRESIDENT Buck . Suppose I said to you I was going to cut away one quarter of your body - but not to worry because you 'd still be three-quarters good , even if that three-quarters was rather monstrously deformed and helplessly crippled . GENERAL SCHMUCK I do n't think that 's a fair analogy , sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Admiral Buldike ? The ADMIRAL squirms . ADMIRAL BULDIKE ( shaking his head ) I do n't know ... I just do n't know . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General Faceman ? He hesitates like a poker player deciding whether to make a call . GENERAL FACEMAN ( cooly ) I 'm afraid I have to flatly disagree with General Schmuck 's proposal . I do n't see how we can just cold-bloodedly hit them . Enter TURGIDSON , a senior Presidential aide . All eyes turn to him . TURGIDSON Mister President , I 've got their Ambassador waiting upstairs . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Good ! Any difficulty ? TURGIDSON I 'm afraid so , and he 's having a fit about the squad of M.P. 's . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Ca n't be helped . Have him brought down here right away . TURGIDSON ( exits ) I 'd better do it myself . PRESIDENT SCHMUCK You 're not going to let him in here - in the War Room ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY The Ambassador is here on my orders . GENERAL SCHMUCK But he 'll hear everything we 're saying . And if he just looks out of that window , he'll see everything we 're doing . ( SCHMUCK refers to the War Room proper ) PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( scowls ) That 's the idea , General Schmuck . ( turns to ZLAT , another senior aide ) Zlat ! ZLAT Sir ? The PRESIDENT looks up at a row of clocks which indicate world time zones . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Zlat , it 's three-forty-five in the afternoon their time . Put through a blitz priority telephone call to Premier Belch . Try him at his office . ZLAT ( hesitates ) We 've never communicated with him on such an informal basis before . It 's possible he won't take the call . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY If they wo n't , Zlat , you 'll tell whoever you get on the phone , a couple of dozen of their cities may be taken out within the next hour and a half . He 'll take the call . ZLAT ( exits ) Yes , sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Frankenstein ! Another senior civilian aide . FRANKENSTEIN Yes , sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Frankenstein , I 'll need a complete communications system set up between this room and the Premier . At least a dozen telephone circuits , radio , tele- printers - the works . FRANKENSTEIN I do n't think any of the maintenance or installation men are in at this hour of the morning sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( sourly ) Try , Frankenstein ! Try ! FRANKENSTEIN ( exits , unhappily ) I 'll try , sir . But I do n't think it 'll do any good . A phone rings . 36a VARIOUS SHOTS - EVERYONE FREEZES ADMIRAL BULDIKE is closest to the phone . ADMIRAL BULDIKE Hello ? ... Yes ... Who is this ? ... I see ... Just a moment . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( softly ) Is it him ? ADMIRAL BULDIKE ( covering phone ) No , sir . I believe it 's personal for General Schmuck . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( puzzled ) Personal ? ADMIRAL BULDIKE Yes . A Miss Milky way , I think she said . GENERAL SCHMUCK closes his eyes slowly , then assumes a very businesslike look and takes the phone . GENERAL SCHMUCK Hello ? ... Yes , Miss Way ... No , that 's quite all right ... Uh-huh ... I 'm a little tied up right now , Miss Way . CUT TO 36b MISS MILKY WAY - FABULOUSLY SPRAWLED ACROSS HER BED - INT . HOTEL ROOM MILKY WAY ( southern accent ) Buck , I know you 're a General and everything , but if you do n't learn to behave in a more gentlemanly way , I 'm going to have to give up being a typist and take that movie offer ... Well , what 's so important ( imitating him ) Yes , Miss Way . Yes , Miss Way . Well , look now . I 'm going to take a bath and have breakfast and you come back here soon , you hear me , `` Buck '' Schmuck ? 37 DAY - AIR SHOT - B-90 `` LEPER COLONY '' 38 INT . B-90 LT.

ZOGG Primary trigger circuit is live . Radio has now finished his part in the action . He picks up a computer but does not use it , merely holding it as he listens , like the rest of the crew , to the remainder of the arming pro- cedure . LT. ZOGG Release first safety . MAJOR KONG First safety . The two operate their switches . Two lights again glow on safety bank of panel . LT. ZOGG Second safety . MAJOR KONG Seond safety .

Master safety on now until bomb run . LT. ZOGG Master safety on . They put the master safety switches up , and on the bombardier's panel we see the two final lights go off . 39 DAWN - BURPELSON AIR FORCE BASE 40 VARIOUS CUTS - DEFENSE TEAMS WAITING 41 MACHINE GUN POSITION Fifty yards outside wire perimeter fence , a first-sergeant and two privates are hunched over a .30 calibre air-cooled machine gun . 41a THEY SEE DOWN ROAD About three hundred yards away , a jeep and three troop trucks cautiously approaching . PRIVATE STIFFSOCKS How do we know they 're saboteurs ? SERGEANT BLUNT ( peering through binoculars ) How do you know they 're not ? PRIVATE TUNG Shut up , Charlie . You heard what the General said - two hundred yards . The vehicles continue closer . SERGEANT BLUNT ( swinging binoculars ) There 's eight more trucks on the North road ! We see the eight trucks about two miles away . PRIVATE STIFFSOCKS I suppose they must be subversives or saboteurs . Why else would they suddenly be coming at four in the morning ? PRIVATE TUNG Natch . 41b OTHER CUTS AROUND BASE PERIMETER of base defense teams watching over their weapons . 41c VARIOUS CUTS - ACTION SEQUENCE SERGEANT BLUNT ( calmly ) Okay , Stiffsocks , open up . The machine gun fires three longish blasts which spray across the path of the land jeep . It swerves into a ditch and turns over . The convoy stops and we see troops leap out of the trucks , dis- persing into the fields on each side of the road . Many are only partly dressed . Two men drag the injured from the overturned jeep . 41d VARIOUS CUTS - TROOPS WAITING The scattered firing gradually stops . All we hear are insects and the distant sound of the second truck convoy . A loudspeaker suddenly clicks on in the distance . COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO ( loudspeaker ) This is Colonel `` Bat '' Guano of the 701st Special Service Battalion . Why are you men firing on us ? Silence . PRIVATE STIFFSOCKS Should we answer ? SERGEANT BLUNT Keep down , you dope , and open up on the first one who shows his head . COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO This is Colonel Guano . We are on a mission from the President . We want to enter the base and speak to General Ripper . Silence . PRIVATE TUNG Brother , that 's a beauty . A special mission from the President . SERGEANT BLUNT I 'll say one thing . You 've got to give the enemy credit for organization and planning . 41e VARIOUS CUTS Two hundred yeards away a skirmishing party of a dozen or so men , widely spaced about thirty yeards apart , rises out of the grass and begins to work its way forward . PRIVATE STIFFSOCKS ( under his breath ) They 've got guts too . The machine gun fires . Three men are hit immediately , the others dive for cover . The firing stops . Ten seconds of silence . COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO This is Colonel Guano . Men , you are firing on your own troops . Unless you surrender within sixty seconds , I am under orders to return your fire . 42 DAY - FLYING SHOT - B-90 `` LEPER COLONY '' 43 INT .

Can you see Bromdingna Island yet ? LT. BALLMUFF ( concentrated on scope ) I do n't think so . He adjusts the brilliance of the radarscope . 43a RADARSCOPE We see two flashes of light . 43b VARIOUS CUTS - ACTION SEQUENCE LT. QUIFFER ( D.S.O . ) Missiles ! Sixty miles off , heading in fast . Steady track , they look like beam riders . MAJOR KONG Roger , keep calling them . ( to co-pilot ) Knock off auto-pilot , Ace . The co-pilot reaches forward and flips two switches . CAPTAIN `` ACE '' ANGST Auto-pilot off , King . MAJOR KONG Lock ECM onto master search radar . LT. QUIFFER ( flipping switches ) ECM locked to master search radar . He looks at the large ECM ( Electronic-Counter-Measures ) control panel . It is an electronic marvel with all the appropriate blinking lights , gauges , and oscillographs . He speaks to himself . LT. QUIFFER ( to ECM ) You big , beautiful brain , you better start thinking . He gives the panel a pat . CAPTAIN ANGST Where do you suppose they were fired from ? MAJOR KONG Quentin , have you picked up any aircraft ? LT. QUIFFER Just the missiles . MAJOR KONG They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202 's . They 've got a range well over a hundred miles . LT. QUIFFER Forty-five . Still coming straight and fast . Twelve o ' clock . MAJOR KONG Speed ? LT. QUIFFER Between Mach 3 and 4 .

WAR ROOM - AMBASADOR DE SADE AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( hysterical ) Mister President , I demand to be taken back to my embassy at once . The AMBASSADOR is clad in striped pyjamas and black , velvet- collared coat . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Please be calm , Ambassador De Sade . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( bitterly ) You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people . The AMBASSADOR yammers away under the PRESIDENT 's speech . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Waffel ! WAFFEL Sir ! PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Please see how they 're getting along on the call to Premier Belch . WAFFEL ( exits ) Yes , sir . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( doubling his fists ) Mister President , are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this ? The PRESIDENT steps in front of the AMBASSADOR to protect him . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General Schmuck ! Ambassador De Sade is here as my guest . He is to be treated with the proper respect . GENERAL SCHMUCK skulks off , scowling . GENERAL SCHMUCK If you say so , sir . The AMBASSADOR was obviously afraid SCHMUCK was going to slug him . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( turns after SCHMUCK ) War-mongering bully ! Do n't think you 're going to intimidate me ! PRESIDENT MUFFLEY All right , Mister Ambassador ! But you must treat General `` Buck '' Schmuck with the respect due him . The AMBASSADOR slumps down in his chair , miserably . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( pathetically ) Can I have a glass of water ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Certainly - how about some breakfast ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( shrugs interestedly ) Possibly some coffee ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( gesturing ) Moffo ! MOFFO , a clean-cut aide . MOFFO ( steps forward ) Would you like anything else with it , Mister Ambassador ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( unhappily ) I reall should n't . I 'll ruin my diet . MOFFO Oh , surely you can break your diet a little today , sir . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( shrugs , sourly ) All right - I 'd like orange juice , three fried eggs turned over , bacon , toast , coffee , and some sweet rolls . MOFFO and pencil catching up . MOFFO I 'll have it brought right down . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( grudgingly ) Thank you . Oh - and can you bring me a pack of AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( cont ) cigarettes - any filtered brand ? Exit , MOFFO . ADMIRAL BULDIKE ( holds out a pack ) Here , have one of mine . The AMBASSADOR takes a cigarette . ADMIRAL BULDIKE lights it with his Ronson . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( exhaling ) Thank you , Admiral . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Now , Mister Ambassador . In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone . I intend to tell him exactly what has happened . I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( looks up suspiciously ) The food - you would n't put - anything in it , would you ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Do n't be ridiculous . AMBASSADOR DE SADE I have your word , Mister President ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Yes , of course . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( savagely , from across the room ) We do n't operate like you KGB boys . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Knock it off will you , General ? ( to CRUDLEY , an aide ) Crudley , find out what 's holding up that call ! Exit CRUDLEY . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Where are you trying to reach him ? PRESIDENT MUFFLEY At his office in the Capitol . AMBASSADOR DE SADE If he 's not there , try ... ( thinks ) 87 - 43 - 56 . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Did you get that , Kulnick ? KULNICK nods and exits . During the next speech , AMBASSADOR DE SADE sidles up to the huge plate-glass window opening out to the War Room . As he talks , he sneaks out a Minox camera , and takes a picture . AMBASSADOR DE SADE His office wo n't have that number . It 's a very special phone number , and the Premier ca n't trust his secretary not to tell his wife . GENERAL SCHMUCK has see him take the photograph and strikes like a cat , grabbing for the camera . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( grappling for camera ) Okay , pal - I 'll take that ! The both fumble for the tiny camera . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Do n't you dare touch me ! What the devil do you think you 're doing ? GENERAL SCHMUCK I caught you red-handed , Mister Ambassador . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Give that back to me . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( flourishing camera ) What do you think of this , Mister President ? ( triumphant ) I told you we should n't let him in here . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY What 's the meaning of this ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE I am sorry . Sub-miniature photography is my hobby . It 's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( annoyed ) I 'll hold this , if you do n't mind . You can have it back when you leave . 47 DAY - AIR SHOT - B-90 A thin wisp of smoke trails from inside port pod . 48 INT .

BALLMUFF You know what that 'll do to our fuel consumption . MAJOR KONG Ca n't help it . What 's the wind like ? LT. QUIFFER Should n't be bad . Might even help . But my guess is we 're going to have to paddle our way back . MAJOR KONG We 'll worry about that later . Okay , I'll take damage reports . 51 INT . GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER 'S OFFICE The popping of small arms fire outside . RIPPER still has MAJOR MANDRAKE at the mercy of his .45 . Stray bursts of small arms fire have smashed the windows , and occasionally a few shots tear up the wall . Both men are on the floor . GENERAL RIPPER is philosophically drunk and very sentimental . GENERAL RIPPER ( sitting on the floor ) You know , when I was a kid , I used to read a lot . I loved to read . One of my favorites was the `` Jungle Book '' by Kipling . Did you ever read it , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE lies flat on the floor and trembles with fear . MAJOR MANDRAKE I do n't think so . A rifle shot splatters the window again . MANDRAKE flinches . GENERAL RIPPER You should . In particular , read the story of the little mongoose , called Riki-tiki-tavi , because of the noise he made . He was taken in as a house pet . In the garden of the house lived a couple of cobras , and pretty soon the mongoose kills the male cobra because he 's laying for the man of the house . MAJOR MANDRAKE manages a brave but idiotic smile . GENERAL RIPPER But the female cobra is left , and she 's got a clutch of eggs which will hatch a dozen young cobras . She decides Riki has to go . She says so , and she means it . The little mongoose weighs up the odds . He can handle the cobra if she comes after him . He just has to keep his eyes open and be ready for her at any time . But once the eggs hatch and the young cobras become dangerous - he 's gone . He ca n't handle that many at once . A longish burst of automatic fire rakes across the wall , window height , dropping three framed 8 x 10 photographs of Air Force Generals . GENERAL RIPPER So he waits his chance , and when the female cobra is causing mischief somewhere else , he breaks the eggs . He has to kill the young cobras since it 's just a matter of time before they kill him . So he acts and he lives . He is safe , the people in the house are safe . They can live their lives in peace . GENERAL RIPPER is glassy-eyed with emotion . MAJOR MANDRAKE nods , stupidly . GENERAL RIPPER Major , pour two more drinks , please . MAJOR MANDRAKE creeps to the bar . GENERAL RIPPER ( as if MANDRAKE were somehow derelict in his duty ) Major , those are my boys out there dying . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( making drinks ) Yes , sir . Why do n't you stop the fighting , sir ? GENERAL RIPPER looks at his watch and begins to nod . He keeps nodding for about thirty seconds . GENERAL RIPPER You 're a good officer , Major Mandrake . You think of your men first . MAJOR MANDRAKE crawls over with the drinks . GENERAL RIPPER ( raising glass , moodily ) To peace on earth , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( mumbles ) Peace on earth . They drink . RIPPER starts nodding again . RIPPER picks up the p.a . mike and fumbles for the switch . GENERAL RIPPER This is General Ripper speaking . There has been an unfortunate mistake . You have been fighting our own troops . They are not saboteurs . You will cease fire immediately . I repeat , cease fire imediately . Good work , men . I 'm proud of you . Shuts off button . MAJOR MANDRAKE General , now that you 've done that , I beg you to recall the Wing . GENERAL RIPPER Major , I happen to believe in a life after this one , so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done . I think I can . They touch glasses and drink . GENERAL RIPPER ( choked with pride ) Major , go out there and stop the fighting . MAJOR MANDRAKE exits , closing the door behind him . 51a CU - GENERAL RIPPER Tears roll down his gallantly insane face . He picks up his .45 automatic . 52 INT . WAR ROOM A telephone is placed on the conference table . ZLAT ( speaking in a strange foreign language ) He covers the mouthpiece . ZLAT ( excited ) They 've got Premier Belch on the line . He 's at that other number . ( makes an inappropriately suggestive hint ) but his interpreter is with him . You'll actually talk to him , and he 'll shoot a simultaneous translation from you to the Premier , and vice vrsa . The PRESIDENT takes a deep breath , sits down , and takes the phone . He thinks for a moment , forces a relaxes look , and speaks . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Hello ... Hello ... Premier Belch ... How are you ? ... This is Merkin ... Yes , Merkin Muffley . How are you ? ... Merkin Muffley ... Sure it is ... Just a second , will you hold on a second ? to AMBASSADOR DE SADE . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY He does n't believe me . ( hands phone ) Please do n't tell him more than that . DE SADE nods worriedly . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( we hear a strange foreign language understanding the name Merkin Muffley ) I told him the call was genuine . DE SADE hands the phone back . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Hello ? ... Yes ... Uh-huh ... certainly I understand ... Oh someone tried it on you once before ... Look , Belch , I 'll tell you why I called ... Hello ... Hello ... Can you hear me ? ... Say , could they turn the music down a little ? ... Oh , well , could they stop playing ? ... Oh , good , I thought we lost the connection there for a minute ... yes , I hear you very clearly ... Well , look ... ( clears throat ) You know how we 've always talked about the possibility of something going wrong ? ... With the H-bomb ... uh-huh ... that 's right ... Well , it happened ... Hello ? ... Can you still hear me ? ... What ? ... Not missiles - planes ... that 's right ... B-90 's ... That 's right ... Thirty-four of them ... In about an hour and a half ... uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... Well , how do you think I feel about it ? ... I know that ... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... Well , why do you think I 'm calling you ? ... to work some- thing out on this disarmament thing ... Uh-huh ... Sure , but you have n't been reasonable ... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... Look Belch ... Look , we 're wasting time ... Uh-huh ... a base commander ... We 're not sure ... Well , we think he 's gone psycho ... Had a mental breakdown ... We 're trying to do that ... We're doing that right now ... Well , we 've got our fingers crosses ... we 're hoping ... We 're trying that too ... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... That 's not fair for you to say ... We 're doing everything we possibly can ... Certainly ... Sure I can imagine ... Uh-huh ... PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( cont ) Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... Look , there 's something else . We want to give your Air Staff a complete rundown on the targets , flight plans , and defensive systems of the planes ... No , it 's on the level ... Sure I hate to do a thing like that , but at this point it's got to be a case of one hand scratches the other ... co-operate ... Right now ... Who should they call ? ... The People 's Central Air Defense Headquarters ? ... Where ? ... In Karnak ? ... Right ... You 'll call them first ... Uh-huh ... Do you happen to have the phone number ? ... Just ask Karnak information ? ... ( he gestures to GENERAL SCHMUCK who exits the room ) What 's that ? ... Yes , I 'm listening ... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... a hundred thousand megatons ... Cobalt- Thorium-G casing ? ... What 's that for ? ... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... Irrevocable and automatic ? ... Uh- huh ... Why did n't you let us know ? ... Sure I know the Party Congress is next week ... Certainly I understand .. but what are we supposed to do about it now ? ... Right ... Okay , well , how long will it take for you to get back to your office ? ... Right , well call me back as soon as you do ... BEdlock 3- 3333 , extension , 2497 ... If you forget , just ask for me ... Right ... Bye-bye . Hangs up phone . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( to AMBASSADOR DE SADE ) The Premier says that 've got a Doomsday Machine that can kill all human life on earth- is that true ? 53 INT . AIR COMMAND COMMUNICATIONS CENTER About a dozen Air Force language experts are communicating via radio , giving the information . 54 DAY - B-90 `` LEPER COLONY '' - FLYING SHOT - SEVERAL CUTS 55 INT . WAR ROOM All eyes are directed to AMBASSADOR DE SADE . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( shaking his head ) It was to have been announced at the party congress next week . I did not know the fools would make it operational until then . DE SADE is plainly shaken and swallows some iced water . GENERAL FACEMAN ( skeptical ) Well , what the hell is a Doomsday Machine ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( pale ) May I have a cigarette ? GENERAL FACEMAN gives him a cigarette and lights it , as he continues . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( shaking his head ) Well , it 's ridiculously simple , really . As you all know , the intense , lethal radio- activity from a so-called normal nuclear device dissipates itself at a certain rate . Something like __________after the first hours , ___________after twenty-four hours , until at the end of a week , it 's just________ of its lethal dose . He takes a deep drag on the cigarette , holds it , and exhales . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Well , it has been explained to me that , if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device , the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( continuing ) Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices , jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape . In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Where is this ... thing ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( suspiciously ) Do you mean to say you 'd set it off in your own country ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE Naturally . It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country . But this way we know it 's safe , and we do n't have the problem of delivering it . GENERAL SCHMUCK Mister President , I ca n't buy this malarkey ; they would n't set the damn thing off . Why should they ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE You 're absolutely right . We would n't . No sane nation ever would . That 's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically . GENERAL SCHMUCK Then all you have to do is untrigger it . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Ah , but if we were able to untrigger it , that would be defeating its purpose . All our enemies would have to do , would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions . We would bluff , naturally , but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it . Now we can say : There is no point trying to intimidate us , we do n't control the Doomsday Machine . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( scornfully ) Mister Ambassador , what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE First of all , economic reasons . It was cheap . The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs . It also seemed ideal in most other respects . It was terrifying , convincing , automatic , and extremely simple to understand . He puffs the cigarette . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Still , any of our leaders opposed it on the grounds : Yes , all well and good , but what happens if it has to be used ? He sighs . AMBASSADOR DE SADE But , finally , one factor tipped the scales . We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY That 's preposterous ! We have no such program ! AMBASSADOR DE SADE The source was ... shall we say , completely reliable . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY The report is entirely untrue . I can assure you of that . GENERAL SCHMUCK Damn it , Mister President . I 've been warning for years that we 're still riddled with traitors . While the following dialogue continues , MOFFO enters with a large tray of food . As unobtrusively as possible , he places it on the conference table , and AMBASSADOR DE SADE pulls up a chair with gusto . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Funkel ! A thin-faced , studious man steps forward . FUNKEL Yes , sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Do we have anything like this in the works ? FUNKEL I 'd heard some talk , but I would n't like to say for sure , Mister President . PRESIDENT What ? ? ? Funkel , you 're suppose to be my scientific advisor ! Do n't you know ? FUNKEL Perhaps Didley , in Weapons Evaluation might know . DIDLEY , a short , crew-cut , studious chap in his early forties , smoking a pipe . DIDLEY ( smiling manfully ) I 'm afraid not , sir . But possibly Von Klutz in Research and Development ? VON KLUTZ ( firmly ) I have n't heard of it , sir ! AMBASSADOR DE SADE Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source ? GENERAL SCHMUCK You mean you 'll tell us his name ? ? ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE It 's not a he , General . It was an article in the `` Times '' about a year and a half ago . VARIOUS AD LIBS What ? The `` Times '' ? ? I always knew it had subversive tendencies . AMBASSADOR DE SADE We get much of our most dependable information from the `` Times '' . As I recall the article said a Doctor Otto Strangelove , at the Bland Corporation , was working on the idea . Naturally , you could not expect us to believe he would be doing such a thing as a hobby ! There is a soft knock , and the door opens without waiting for a reply . MAJOR NONCE , one of GENERAL SCHMUCK 's Air Force aides , enters . GENERAL SCHMUCK Yes , Nonce . What is it ? MAJOR NONCE ( factually ) Gentlemen , we have just received word that the base at Burpelson has surrendered . 56 INT . GENERAL RIPPER 'S OFFICE The scene opens as if on a still photograph . MAJOR MANDRAKE stands motionless and expressionless in the bullet-splattered office . CAMERA moves and reveals GENERAL RIPPER grotesquely sprawled , face down , on the floor behind his desk , the .45 nearby . MANDRAKE kneels next to RIPPER and confirms he is dead . MANDRAKE rises and leans on the desk . He sees a wallet of photographs neatly laid out , obviously RIPPER's mother and father . Examining the clutter on RIPPER 's desk , he notices a ruled yellow legal-size tablet . There are a number of boxes , heavily drawn . CAMERA moves in closer to tablet . We see a repetition of the phrase `` Peace on Earth . '' It is scribbled about eight times . 56a COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO - ENTERS - PYJAMA TOP AND BATTLE GEAR A tough , crew-cut , youngish ( 35 ) Battalion commander . Carbine slung over his shoulder , helmet hanging from carbine , he swaggers into the office standing for a moment , hands on hips , surveying the scene . MAJOR MANDRAKE is seated at the desk , staring off into space and apparently babbling utter nonsense . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( weirdly ) Peace On Earth ... Peace On Earth ... Peace On Earth ... He does n't acknowledge COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO 's presence . COLONEL GUANO stares at him suspiciously . COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO ( softly ) Major ? ... Major ? I 'm Colonel `` Bat '' Guano , 701 Battalion . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( pinching the bridge of his nose and grimacing ) Come in ... come in ... Peace On Earth ... Peace On Earth ... yes ... COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO Why are you saying that phrase over and over again ? MAJOR MANDRAKE I think that just might be it ! Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi . COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO ( scowls , suspiciously ) What are you talking about , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE ( starting to babble ) The three-letter code group . Or maybe some combination of the three letters . P ... O ... E , or P ... E ... O , or E ... O ... P ... let 's see , there would be six possible combinations . COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO ( shouting ) Get a grip on yourself , Major ! MAJOR MANDRAKE It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi . R ... T ... T ... There 's only three combinations of -- T ... T ... R , or T ... R ... T ... COLONEL GUANO gives MAJOR MANDRAKE an open-handed whack in the face ! MANDRAKE lets out a howl of pain . COLONEL `` BAT '' GUANO Now , snap out of it , fella ! MAJOR MANDRAKE ( holding face ) Who the hell do you think you are , sir ? ? ? COLONEL GUANO ( John Wayne ) I did that for your own good , fella . Now I 'm not going to pull rank on you . When this is over , I 'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing . Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President . MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , you ca n't do that because he 's dead . He points to the floor behind the desk . COLONEL GUANO steps forward and looks at the body . He kneels and examines the body , suspiciously . COLONEL GUANO moves carefully to the other side of the desk , unslings his carbine , and covers MAJOR MANDRAKE . COLONEL GUANO Do you have any witnesses , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE What ? COLONEL GUANO What happened , Major ? Some kind of private beef between the two of you ? MAJOR MANDRAKE ( incredulous ) Look , I did n't shoot him ! COLONEL GUANO We 'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D . boys , wo n't we , Major ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Look , Colonel . I 've got to talk to somebody at Air Command . COLONEL GUANO Do n't worry , Major . Your rights will be fully protected . MAJOR MANDRAKE Colonel , do n't you know what 's going on ? COLONEL GUANO Sure I do . There was some kind of mutiny on the base , and you killed General Ripper . MAJOR MANDRAKE Look , General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs . COLONEL GUANO ( smiles ) You must think I 'm an awful sap , Major . ( MAJOR MANDRAKE starts to move ) Just sit down , fella , and keep your hands on the desk ! MAJOR MANDRAKE Did n't they tell you ? COLONEL GUANO ( shaking head ) They told me , Major . And I did n't hear anything about any atomic attack . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( talks slowly and simple ) Look , Colonel . You keep me covered , but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters . Okay ? ... I wo n't play any tricks on you ... Okay ? COLONEL GUANO ca n't think of any good reason not to . COLONEL GUANO Okay , fella . But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me . MAJOR MANDRAKE Sure ... sure , Colonel . Now look , I 'm picking up the phone ... nice and slow . Right ? ... Hello ? ... Hello ? ( he clicks the receiver ) Hello ? ... Hello ? ... Gee , it must be edad . Probably the lines were hit during the fighting . COLONEL GUANO watches him like a hawk . MAJOR MANDRAKE Now look , I 'm picking up this ordinary telephone . See ? ... Hello ? ... Hello ? ... Nuts , the lines must still be disconnected . ( he smiles idiotically ) The General had us disconnect ... ( he lets his voice trail off when he sees RUDLEY 's weird look of hatred and suspicion ) MAJOR MANDRAKE ( desperately ) Look , Colonel . Maybe it 's too late . Maybe they 've sent Air Command in already . But we 've got to try to con- tact somebody . COLONEL GUANO On your feet , fella . I 've got to get outside and see how my men are . MAJOR MANDRAKE Okay , Colonel . But look , there 's a pay phone just outside in the hall . Maybe that works , huh ? Maybe it 'll work ? What do you think ? COLONEL GUANO You 've wasted enough of my time , fella . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( snaps his fingers ) Wait a minute . The President ! ! That 's it ! The President ! ! ! COLONEL GUANO ( suspiciously ) What about the President ? MAJOR MANDRAKE He wanted to talk to General Ripper , didn't he ? COLONEL GUANO ( the wheel turns slowly ) So what ? MAJOR MANDRAKE Well , I 'm General Ripper 's Executive officer . He 'll want to talk to me . COLONEL GUANO 's mind is not prepared for this new twist . He cocks his head to one side and studies MANDRAKE . MAJOR MANDRAKE Do n't you see ? He 'll want to talk to me ! And if he finds out that you would n't let MAJOR MANDRAKE ( Cont ) him talk to me ... Well , I 'd say you 'd be in for a pretty severe reprimand , Colonel . QUICK DISSOLVE 56b PHONE BOOTH IN HALL - MANDRAKE AND GUANO MAJOR MANDRAKE is seated in the booth , illuminated by a bright flourescent overhead , his hand on the half-closed door . COLONEL GUANO leans against the door jamb , listening . His carbine points down , but his grip indicates he is n't taking any chances . MAJOR MANDRAKE ( a lot of change spread out in front of him ) Operator , this is Major Mandrake at Burpelson Air Force Base . I would like to place an emergency call to Merkin Muffley at the Capitol . That 's right , the President ... Try the War Room . He smiles , hopefully , at COLONEL GUANO 's sinister face . MAJOR MANDRAKE That 's right , operator , the President ... Operator , how much will that be for the first three minutes ? ... Two dollars and twenty-five cents ? He quickly counts his change and sees it 's not enough . He starts fumbling through his pockets . No more change . MAJOR MANDRAKE Look , operator , can you make this a collect call ? That 's right , Major Mandrake from Burpelson ... They are n't allowed to ? ... Tell them it 's terrifically important ... Just a second ... He opens the door and addresses COLONEL GUANO . MAJOR MANDRAKE Colonel , they are n't allowed to accept any collect long-distance calls . The operator MAJOR MANDRAKE ( Cont ) says it 's policy . I need fifty-five cents . COLONEL GUANO ( contemptuously ) I would n't carry loose change going into combat . MAJOR MANDRAKE looks around desperately . A Coke machine stands next to the phone booth . MAJOR MANDRAKE Operator ... How much would the call be station-to-station ? ... Thirty-five cents cheaper ? ... I 'd still be short twenty cents ... Just a second , operator ... ( covers mouthpiece ) Colonel , shoot the lock off the Coke machine . ( he points ) There 's bound to be enough change in there . COLONEL GUANO ( weakly ) That 's government property , Major . MAJOR MANDRAKE Colonel , remember , a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer ... Just a second , operator , I know I have it somewhere . COLONEL GUANO apologetically fires a shot into the coin box . Coins spill on the floor in profusion , as well as a stream of Coke in the COLONEL 's sputtering face . 57 DAY - B-90 - FLYING SHOT - SEVERAL CUTS As the `` Leper Colony '' presses on . 58 INT . WAR ROOM Enter , GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( with quiet majesty ) Mister President , Gentlemen , we are saved . AD LIBS ( overlapping ) What ? Wow ! You mean that was it ? The old know-how . GENERAL SCHMUCK basks in the grandeur of the moment . GENERAL SCHMUCK It was a variation of `` Peace on Earth '' - OPE to be exact . AD LIBS ( overlapping ) Can you beat that ? Peace on Earth . Brother ! The human mind sure is amazing . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Have you received acknowledgements from every plane ? GENERAL SCHMUCK They 're coming in now . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY How long will it take to receive them all ? GENERAL SCHMUCK I 'm not certain , Mister President . The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work . The tone of GENERAL SCHMUCK 's remark is as if to say : I am not your errand boy . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General Schmuck , if you do n't know the answer , please find out ! GENERAL SCHMUCK decides against a head-on collision . GENERAL SCHMUCK I believe it will be just a few minutes , at the most . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY How many planes did we lose ? GENERAL SCHMUCK I 'm not certain , Mister President . But I believe it was four . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General Faceman , what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson ? GENERAL FACEMAN I did n't speak to him , sir . But Colonel `` Bat '' Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion , so I would imagine he did . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY I want him upped to Brigadier General , and recomended for the D.S.C . GENERAL FACEMAN ( beaming ) Yes , sir . GENERAL SCHMUCK I do n't know about the rest of you , Gentlemen , but I 'm going to get down on my knees and say a short prayer of thanks . AMBASSADOR DE SADE stands with a flourish of contempt , pushing away his breakfast tray . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Excuse me , but I 'm afraid I have many more urgent things to attend to . I should appreciate it if you would delay your pious moment long enough for me to say something . His tone of voice is loaded with contempt , challenge , and atheism . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( darkly ) Yes ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people . THE PRESIDENT has just about had it with De Sade and is stung by the rudeness of his tone . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Damn you , de Sade ! You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual , whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( haughtily ) It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( fiercely ) How dare you talk to me in this manner ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE scornfully replies with silence . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( boiling with indignation ) This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government had n't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control ! ! AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( waspishly ) Bah ! All you wanted to do was spy in our country ! PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( wrathfully ) That 's nonsense , and you know it ! AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( acrimoniously ) I know nothing of the sort ! PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( exasperated ) Surely , you do n't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same ? AMBASSADOR DE SADE And surely you do n't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( savagely ) Do n't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion , that in fact , you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require ? You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and , of course , we are obliged to place the same trust in you . The PRESIDENT walks close to DE SADE , eyes flashing . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( raging ) Is there a single phase of human activity that is free from the idiotic mischance ? How often do we read of banks adding three zeros to a hundred dollar deposit ? Or the Postal Department engraving a stamp with the wrong amount ? Or an operation performed on the wrong patient ? The PRESIDENT continues with mounting fury . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( shouting rabidly ) The bomb may deter a rational leader from choosing deliberate war , but it can not deter a madman , or a short-circuit , or an error in judgment . And since neither of us can reduce the chances for the idiotic mischance to zero , it simply becomes a question of when ? ZLAT has been holding the phone . ZLAT Mister President , I think Premier Belch is coming back on the line . He 's back in his office . 59 DAY - LOW LEVEL - FLYING SHOT - B-90 - OVER ARCTIC TERRAIN 60 INT . B-90 - VARIOUS CUTS TO CREW Low-level terrain features flashing by . MAJOR KONG Let 's have a rundown on the damage , Lothar ? LT. ZOGG ( bombardier ) Everything still checks out okay . MAJOR KONG Binky ? LT. BINKY BALLMUFF ( navigator ) Okay , Major . MAJOR KONG Check . Quentin ? LT. QUENTIN QUIFFER ( peevishly ) Look , I have n't really been able to check - I 'm shot . MAJOR KONG Are you hit bad ? LT. QUIFFER Yeah , I got it in the thigh . MAJOR KONG Lieutenant Toejam , why do n't you help him ? The radio man , LIEUTENANT TERRY TOEJAM , is sitting right next to the wounded D.S.O . LT. TOEJAM I thought I should check out the damage first . My gear is busted up pretty bad . MAJOR KONG Lieutenant Toejam 's going to help you in a minute . Can you check your ECM ? LT. QUIFFER Why ca n't he help me now ? He 's sitting two feet away from me ! MAJOR KONG Come on , Quentin , is n't that pretty selfish , putting yourself ahead of the mission ? LT. QUIFFER Look , I 'm shot - it hurts . MAJOR KONG ( firmly ) Lieutenant Quiffer , we 're all sorry you were hit , and we 'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away . LT. QUIFFER Look , ca n't someone help me ? CAPTAIN ANGST ( unsympathetically ) King , I 'm not busy . MAJOR KONG ( shrugs ) Captain Angst is coming back to help you . LT. TOEJAM Major Kong , I 'm still trying to unravel the leads , but it looks hopeless . All radio gear is kaput , including the CRM-114 . I guess we 're on our own . 60a CU - CRM-114 - IT IS SMASHED AND TWISTED AND CHARRED 60b CU - MAJOR KONG MAJOR KONG All right , then , here 's the situation . With our ECM and staying on the deck , they should n't be able to track us on radar . We should make it to the primary and take out the missile base . We 're burning up alot of fuel at this altitude , and we may not make it back to a useable base . But I think there's an excellent chance to bail out over neutral territory . 61 INT . WAR ROOM The PRESIDENT speaks with the confidence of a salesman after he has closed a deal . The Ambassador is still there . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Hello ? ... Belch ? ... I just wanted to let you know everything 's all right ... Uh-huh ... Certainly ... We broke the code ... Uh-huh ... Yes , they 've all acknowledged the recall ... Uh-huh ... Thirty ... Originally ? ... there were thirty-four ... That 's right - we figure four shot down ... Are you sure of that ? ... I see ... Will you hold it for a second . The PRESIDENT covers the phone and fixes a withering look on GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General Schmuck , are you positive of your figures ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Naturally I am , sir . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY He says they 've only shot down three planes . GENERAL SCHMUCK Well , if you choose to take his word over mine -- - PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Look , he 's there , and you 're here . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( nettled ) Mister President , there were thirty-four aircraft involved . Thirty acknowledged the recall . That makes four shot down . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( back to phone ) Hello , are you still there ? ... Uh-huh ... I'll be right back . We 're still working this thing out . Covering the phone , the PRESIDENT directs himself again to SCHMUCK . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY How do you know they were shot down , Buck ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Well , just common sense , sir . Thirty from thirty-four equals four , or my name 's not `` Buck '' Schmuck ! The PRESIDENT dolefully digests GENERAL SCHMUCK 's logic . There is a low , squawking sound from the telephone . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Hello ? ... Yes ... What ? ... Uh-huh ... You're absolutely certain ? ( sighs ) Hold it a second , will you ? ( covers phone ) He says they 've just received a report of a single , low-flying B-90 apparently still continuing on an attack mission , to what they assume would be a missile complex at a place called Laputa . AD LIBS What ? Impossible ! Ridiculous ! During the last part of the PRESIDENT 's speech , another phone rang several times . TURGIDSON picked it up and talked in hushed tones . TURGIDSON ( softly ) General Schmuck , it 's Miss Milky Way again . She insists on speaking to you . GENERAL SCHMUCK Good Lord , Turgidson ! I ca n't talk to her now . TURGIDSON I told her you were busy , General Schmuck , but she got rather huffy . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( wearily ) Turgidson , tell her I 'll call her back in a few minutes . ADMIRAL BULDIKE ( replaces phone ) Mister President , the latest radar contacts indicate the enemy are still building up over the Arctic pack . We estimate five-hundred- plus aircraft . 62 DAY - LOW LEVEL - B-90 FLYING SHOT 63 INT . B-90 - OVER PILOT 'S SHOULDER Looking out over nose of the plane . Trees , a road , a cluster of houses , a small town , all flash by . 63a VARIOUS CUTS AND INSERTS The D.S.O . is bandaged up and apparently functioning again . LT. QUIFFER Major Kong , I have two blips - must be fighters . See insert of radarscope . MAJOR KONG Roger . LT. QUIFFER ( looks at radarscope again ) Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles . MAJOR KONG They must have made a visual contact . LT. QUIFFER Must be Mach two-five stuff . Altitude fifteen thousand . MAJOR KONG They ca n't touch us at this height . LT. QUIFFER They 're moving apart . DISSOLVE 64 INT . WAR ROOM Enter GENERAL SCHMUCK , shaking his head morosely . GENERAL SCHMUCK It 's beginning to look like someone 's made somewhat of an error , sir . The PRESIDENT closes his eyes and breathes heavily . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( softly ) Yes ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Well , sir , it looks like one aircraft , the `` Leper Colony '' , failed to receive the recall . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY Have you tried the recall again ? GENERAL SCHMUCK Yes , sir . We 're still sending it . But it's a funny thing we do n't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY What 's the target . GENERAL SCHMUCK Well , the Premier doped it out pretty well . Its primary is their missile base at Laputa . The PRESIDENT slumps into a chair . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( mournfully ) Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense , when its course and target are known ? GENERAL SCHMUCK ( glancing at the AMBASSADOR ) If I can speak freely , sir -- look , these guys talk big , but frankly , we think they 're short of know-how . You ca n't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys , and I do n't mean that as an insult , Mister Ambassador . Hell , we all know what kind of guts your people have . Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis ( pronounced NAZZEES ) killed and , hell , they still would n't quit . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY General , stick to the point , please . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( making diving aircraft hands ) Well , sir , if the A/C 's a really good man , I mean really sharp , why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time . A real big plane , like a Sting Ray , zig-zagging in , its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard -- - ( almost feverish with excitement ) Has he a chance ? ..... Hell , yes ! He has one hell of a chance . 65 DUSK - LOW LEVEL - B-90 66 INT . B-90 VARIOUS CUTS LT. QUIFFER They 're starting down , King . Looks like LT. QUIFFER ( Cont ) they 're going to cross in port and starboard . MAJOR KONG If they come down low enough to make a firing pass , they 'll never be able to pull up in time . LT. QUIFFER I think they mean business . MAJOR KONG Hang on , boys . He starts a violent series of S-ing and zig-zagging . 67 TWO ENEMY `` KILLERSHARK '' ALL-WEATHER FIGHTERS maneuver in a steep dive , trying to hang on to their slower and more maneuverable quarry . 67a REAR SHOT - LOW LEVEL - B-90 - S-ING AND ZIG-ZAGGING at tree-top height , over the moonlit countryside . 67b VARIOUS INTERCUTS - AIRCRAFT MANEUVERING 67c ENEMY FIGHTERS Each fires a salvo of rockets from above , a bad angle for heat- seeking missiles . 67d B-90 TAKING EVASIVE ACTION The rockets pass over and under , exploding with bright flashes as they hit the ground . 67e ONE ROCKET is exploded by its proximity fuse about nine feet from the fuselage , just behind the crew section . 67f INT . B-90 - VARIOUS QUICK CUTS Flash , black smoke , choking coughs . 67g ENEMY FIGHTERS Make no attempt to pull out of their dives and continue to maneuver apparently trying to ram the bomber . They swoop down and in from port and starboard like two hawks . 67h B-90 wildly maneuvers and manages narrowly to evade both fighters who , unable to pull up , explode against the ground in bright balls of flames . 68 INT . B-90 - VARIOUS CUTS The smoke has cleared to a greyish mist . A jagged hole about four feet at its widest has been blasted out of the rear of the crew section . 68a MAJOR KONG is wounded in the back . His vision clouds with pain as he fights to maintain consciousness . MAJOR KONG Ace , you better take it . All fire switches ... on . He turns to the co-pilot . 68b CO-PILOT `` ACE '' ANGST IS DEAD though no wound is apparent . 68c MAJOR KONG spasmodically takes deep breaths . Summoning up all his nerve and concentration , he leans forward and flips the `` fire '' switches at the same time flying the plane and intermittently glancing into the moonlit terrain flashing under the nose of the big plane . 68d VARIOUS CUTS MAJOR KONG Somebody come up here quick , I 'm hit . The seating arrangement in the B-90 is such that the upper deck places the D.S.O . and the radio man about ten feet behind the pilot and co-pilot , facing the tail of the plane . The bombardier and the navigator sit facing forward on a second and lower level . Naturally , Major Kong expects help from the nearest crew- member , the D.S.O . or the radio man . MAJOR KONG Come on ! Hurry up . He twists himself painfully to look over his shoulder . 68e TWO SHOT - LT. QUIFFER AND LT. TOEJAM The D.S.O . studiously attends to his work . The radio , Lieutenant TERRY TOEJAM , sits cross-legged , examining his ankle . LT. QUIFFER ( without turning around ) Sorry , King . My leg 's stiff as a board . MAJOR KONG ( to radio man ) Hey , Terry , I 'm hit . LT. TOEJAM ( minutely studying a slight ankle wound ) So am I . MAJOR KONG Listen , I think I 'm hit bad . LT. TOEJAM ( still absorbed in his ankle ) Where 'd they get you ? MAJOR KONG Damn you , Lieutenant Toejam ! Lothar ! LT. ZOGG Yes , Major . MAJOR KONG Lothar , get up here fast , and bring your First- Aid kit ! I 'm hit kinda bad , I think . LT. ZOGG Ca n't `` Ace '' help you ? MAJOR KONG He 's dead . LT. ZOGG What happened ? MAJOR KONG I bit his jugular vein . Now will you shut up and get up here ? ? ? LT. ZOGG Sure ! Sure , I 'm on my way . While the colored bombardier works his way up the ladder , MAJOR KONG takes a long and uncomprehending look at his dead buddy , Captain `` ACE '' ANGST . LT. ZOGG ( puffing ) Where 'd they get you ? MAJOR KONG ( grimaces ) In the back ... feels like an arrowhead . The BOMBARDIER looks at the co-pilot . LT. ZOGG How do you know he 's dead ? MAJOR KONG Hell , he looks dead . The bombardier raises the co-pilot 's eyelid and confirms that he is dead . LT. ZOGG He 's dead , all right . MAJOR KONG Listen , give me a shot quick ! The BOMBARDIER fumbles in the first-aid kit for a morphine Syrette . While fixing syringe , BOMBARDIER looks down at back of Pilot 's seat . 68f CU - SEAT We see two small jagged holes ripped in the back of the chair . 68g CU - BOMBARDIER - LT. ZOGG He looks and frowns . 68h MS - NAVIGATOR - LT. `` BINKY '' BALLMUFF LT. BALLMUFF Correct course to two-seven-three . We should be about a hundred and forty miles away from Laputa . Be there in about six- teen minutes . 68i MASTER SHOT MAJOR KONG Okay , Binky , two-seven-three . ( to LT. ZOGG ) Lothar , any damage down below ? Rolls up his sleeve . LT. ZOGG I do n't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam . MAJOR KONG Quentin , how 's your gear ? BOMBARDIER gives him shot . LT. QUENTIN QUIFFER I do n't know . MAJOR KONG What do you mean , you do n't know ? LT. QUIFFER I have n't checked . I 'm bleeding again . MAJOR KONG shakes his head in disappointment . MAJOR KONG ( slowly and very John Wayne ) The hydraulic systems out , Lothar , and a lot of wiring is hanging loose . The number MAJOR KONG ( Cont ) one and three port engines are hit , and the fuel 's leaking . But we 're still flying . And what 's more , we 're going to carry out our mission . LT. ZOGG ( looking out over nose of plane ) Look , Major . What 's that ? 68j DISTANT HORIZON - FORWARD Eight powerful aircraft searchlights cut long narrow streaks into the night sky . But , instead of a steady beam , they are blinking on and off in fairly close unison . 68k CU - MAJOR KONG Bravely trying to comprehend the distant lights . 68l CU - BOMBARDIER - LT. LOTHAR ZOGG Screwing up his face in bewilderment . 68m DISTANT VIEW - SEARCHLIGHTS BLINKING ON AND OFF 68n CU - MAJOR KONG Narrows his eyes suspiciously . MAJOR KONG ( softly ) I 'll be damned . 68o CU - BOMBARDIER - LT. ZOGG Staring blankly . LT. ZOGG ( softly ) Yeah . 68p TWO SHOT - KONG AND ZOGG Both men numbly stare at the distant searchlights . MAJOR KONG ( into intercom ) Binky , Quentin , Terry ! Come forward - quick ! 68q CUTS OF THE CREW SCRAMBLING TO COCKPIT 68r THE GROUP - FAVORING PILOT LT. QUIFFER , LT. ZOGG , LT. BALLMUFF , and LT. TOEJAM crowded behind him . MAJOR KONG Look . 68s DISTANT VIEW OUT OVER INSTRUMENTS The searchlights continue their signaling . 68t CU - LT. QUIFFER - PUZZLED 68u CU - LT. BALLMUFF - PERPLEXED 68v CU - LT. TOEJAM - CURIOUS 68w MS - THE GROUP MAJOR KONG What does it look like ? LT. TOEJAM Some kind of signaling . MAJOR KONG No kidding . LT. TOEJAM ( uncertainly ) Let 's see ... International Morse , I think ... K ... E ... O ... P ... E ... R ... E ... C ... A ... L ... L ... M ... I ... S ... T ... A ... K ... E ... O ... P ... E ... Gee , I do n't know , it seems to be some kind of code . The negro bombardier , LT. LOTHAR ZOGG , has been jotting it down . LT. ZOGG No , look ! It 's `` OPE - Recall Mistake . '' MAJOR KONG Recall what mistake ? LT. ZOGG No , I think it means , `` Recall period Mistake , '' and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code . Terry ? LT. TOEJAM ( shrugs ) I 'll go back and check my code book . He hops on his bad ankle back to his desk . MAJOR KONG ( shaking his head ) You sure have to hand it to those guys . LT. ZOGG What do you mean ? MAJOR KONG I mean pulling a stunt like that . LT. ZOGG What are you talking about ? LT. TOEJAM hops forward again . LT. TOEJAM Yep , it 's the CRM-114 code , all right . MAJOR KONG Very interesting . LT. ZOGG What do you mean ? MAJOR KONG Well , we sure as hell are n't going home just because the enemy tells us to . LT. ZOGG Wait a minute , Major . `` OPE , '' that 's the recall code . Where would they get that ? MAJOR KONG You tell me . LT. ZOGG They must have gotten it from the base . No one else would know it . MAJOR KONG Why should they call us back ? LT. ZOGG How the hell do I know ? Maybe the war's over . LT. TOEJAM ( bewildered ) Could be . LT. QUIFFER ( wistfully ) I hope we won . MAJOR KONG Lieutenant Zogg , what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission ? LT. ZOGG Look , this is different . MAJOR KONG Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders . And therefore , to disregard anything that does n't come on the CRM-114 . LT. ZOGG But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour . MAJOR KONG Then that settles it , does n't it ? LT. ZOGG Like hell it does . MAJOR KONG ( impatiently ) The CRM-114 is smashed , right ? LT. ZOGG Right . So how could we get any messages ? MAJOR KONG ( ruffled ) That 's the point . LT. ZOGG I do n't get you , King . MAJOR KONG I said that 's the point ! LT. ZOGG Look , King , maybe you 've lost too much blood , or something . MAJOR KONG ( explodes ) Lieutentant Zogg , how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back ? ? ? LT. ZOGG Take it easy , Major Kong . MAJOR KONG Then get off my back ! LT. TOEJAM I think Major Kong 's right , Lothar . I mean we got the attack order from base , and Plan -R is an emergency plan for a base commander after a lot of other plans have been clobbered . LT. ZOGG Okay ! You tell me how the enemy got the code ! It 's put in our sealed plans at the base just before we take off . MAJOR KONG There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose . LT. ZOGG But the code is made up by General Ripper , and he 's the only one left at the base who would know the code . MAJOR KONG Nobody 's loyalty is beyond question . Besides , how do we know one of his staff did n't see it ? LT. ZOGG Come on , King . That does n't make sense . MAJOR KONG ( triumphantly ) Okay , how do we know they did n't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew ? How do we know that ? LT. ZOGG frowns . MAJOR KONG ( the clincher ) We crossed the coast over an hour ago . Okay ? LT. ZOGG ( after some thought ) You 're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball . MAJOR KONG First lesson in War College : Never under- estimate your enemy . LT. ZOGG ( shrugs ) Sorry , King . MAJOR KONG Forget it . Okay , team , let 's break it up and get ready for the kick-off . The team scatters back to their stations . DISSOLVE 69 LOW LEVEL - B-90 - FLYING SHOT 70 INT . B-90 - LT. ZOGG He anxiously flips switches , bangs panels with the palm of his hand , curses to himself , and flips more switches . Various insert cuts to important-looking switches and warning lights . LT. ZOGG King ? 70a MS - PILOT - MAJOR KONG Rocking in his seat and emitting soft groans . MAJOR KONG Who 's that ? LT. ZOGG It 's me - Lothar . Are you okay ? MAJOR KONG I 'm okay . What 's up ? LT. ZOGG Well , I hate to say this , but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck . MAJOR KONG Are you sure ? LT. ZOGG Well , I ca n't get out and look , King . But I do n't get a green light . MAJOR KONG Maybe the warning system 's out . LT. ZOGG But I get a red light . MAJOR KONG Have you tried the emergency system ? LT. ZOGG I tried everything . Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took . 70b CU - PILOT He stares out over the nose of the plane for several seconds . A portentous look of valour seems to overcome the pain . MAJOR KONG Lothar , can you arm the bombs for impact ? LT. ZOGG But I TOLD YOU , I do n't think we can get the bomb bay doors open . MAJOR KONG I asked you a question , Lothar ! LT. ZOGG But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors wo n't -- - ( the penny drops ) Hey , King .... you 're not thinking of -- - You do n't mean you 'd -- - ? ? ? 70c CUTS TO OTHER CREW MEMBERS AS THEY REALIZE THE PLAN MAJOR KONG ( firmly ) There 's no other way , Lothar . Can you re-arm the bombs for impact ? LT. ZOGG ( stunned silence ) Let me check . MAJOR KONG There 's no other way , boys . I 'm going to have to take her in ... the hard way . 70d CUTS TO CREW - HORRIFIED , SWEATING , TREMBLING LT. QUIFFER Say , King . If there was any way I could help , I would n't think of asking , but would you mind if I bailed out . MAJOR KONG is clearly hurt by this lack of comradeship . MAJOR KONG ( shrugs ) No , I would n't mind , Lieutenant Quiffer . 70e CUTS TO FRIGHTENED AND CONFUSED CREW LT. ZOGG ( uncertainly ) I think it 's okay , King . They should go off on impact . MAJOR KONG ( audaciously ) Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle ? I mean , do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger ? LT. ZOGG ( faintly ) Well , it would probably help if you took it ... sort of ... straight down . MAJOR KONG Roger . The other crew members unhappily watch the D.S.O. , LT. QUIFFER , prepare to bail out . His leg seems to have unstiffened . He pauses long enough to notice his buddies . LT. QUIFFER Look , King , maybe the other boys don't think it right to ask , so I 'm asking for them . Can they bail out too ? MAJOR KONG stiffens at this last shattering of camaraderie . MAJOR KONG ( in an angry sulk ) Anyone that wants to save his neck certainly ought to . The other crew members hastily get ready to jump . LT. TOEJAM Gee , we hate to leave you like this , Major Kong . But there is n't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around . MAJOR KONG ( shrugs ) Forget it . LT. QUIFFER Well , listen , King . Could you take her up to about eight hundred ? That 'll help you come in at a nice down-angle , and it 'll give us a chance for our chutes to open . MAJOR KONG ( shrugs ) Sure , I 'll take her up to eight hundred . LT. QUIFFER Could you take her up right now , King ? Other- wise we 'll get kind of close to the fireball . MAJOR KONG ( shrugs ) Sure , I 'll take her up right now . He pulls up the nose of the plane sharply . The men get ready . 71 FLYING SHOT - B-90 CLIMBING As it reaches eight hundred feet , enemy radar , hitherto prevented from tracking the plane due to its low-level tactics , suddenly zeros in , and all kinds of flak and tracer fire open up . LT. TOEJAM Listen , King , old buddy . On behalf -- - MAJOR KONG Skip it and jump , damn you ! This flak 's so close , I can smell it . The crew bails out . AD LIBS ( as they go ) Good luck , King ! God bless you , King ! Geronimo ! MAJOR KONG starts to fly evasive tactics through the flak . 72 MS - NEGRO BOMBARDIER LT. ZOGG - FLOPS INTO CO-PILOT 'S SEAT LT. ZOGG ( softly ) We 're on course , Major . Just fixed our position on that river back there . MAJOR KONG What the hell are you doing here , Lothar ? The two men are deeply touched by this Stanley Kramer-ish moment of truth . LT. ZOGG ( with masculine simplicity ) I thought I 'd go along for the ride . MAJOR KONG ( John Wayne ) Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for , Lothar ? LT. ZOGG I thought maybe you 'd like some company . MAJOR KONG punches him in the arm . MAJOR KONG That sure was a hell of a stupid thing to do . The flak rocks the plane , and the lights of the city ahead continue to flash . LT. ZOGG King , would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in ? MAJOR KONG ( John Wayne - all the way ) I 'd be mighty proud if you did , Lothar . LT. ZOGG Thanks , King . I 've always wanted to take one of these big babies in . MAJOR KONG Listen , Lothar . You know that crack I made about your ... butt ? LT. ZOGG Forget it . MAJOR KONG I just wanted you to know I did n't mean anything by it . LT. ZOGG Sure , King . MAJOR KONG Well , I just wanted you to know how I felt . Hell , I know Air Command would n't have taken you if you were n't okay . And do n't think I do n't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent . 73 NIGHT - EXT . - THE B-90 DIVES INTO THE MISSILE COMPLEX ( TRICK SHOT ) There is a tremendous thermonuclear explosion caused by two 20- megaton H-bombs . CUT TO 74 INT . WAR ROOM Everyone is predictably gloomy and philosophical . It should be apparent they 've heard the news . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( shaking his head , miserably ) It 's wrong . ( sighs ) It 's dead wrong . ADMIRAL BULDIKE ( shaking his head , wretchedly ) It 's not right . No one is really talking to anyone else . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( indignant ) I do n't care what anyone says , it just doesn't seem to make sense to end all human life on Earth . ADMIRAL BULDIKE I suppose the fishes will take over the world . GENERAL FACEMAN Ugh-hhhh , that 's a horrible thought . GENERAL SCHMUCK It 's all so pointless . I mean a man works his whole life fighting for something , and this is what he gets . ( bitterly ) You know , I can see twenty , forty , a hundred million - but everybody ? It 's just a damned shame , and I do n't mind saying so . The PRESIDENT sits alone in the corner of the room . He says nothing . ZLAT ( responsibility weighs heavy ) Mister President , how are we going to break it to the people ? I mean it 's going to do one hell of a thing to your image . The PRESIDENT shrugs , irritably . VON KLUTZ ( with Germanic coolness ) Mister Ambassador , how long will it take ? The AMBASSADOR looks up , wearily . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( gesturing with both hands ) Four - possibly six months in the Northern Hemispheres . Perhaps a year in the Southern latitudes . VON KLUTZ ( wiping his steel-rimmed glasses ) Mister President , I wouldnot rule out the chance to preserve a nucleus of human specimens , at the bottom shafts of some of our deepest mines . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( tiredly ) At the bottom of mines ? VON KLUTZ ( carefully putting on glasses ) Yes . The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep . The PRESIDENT looks blankly at VON KLUTZ . VON KLUTZ In a matter of weeks , sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY But they could n't come out for a hundred years ! VON KLUTZ ( smiling wisely ) Mister President , man is an amazingly adaptable creature . After all , the conditions would be far superior to those , say , of the Nazi concentration camps , where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life . Although the PRESIDENT seems unconvinced , looking around the room , it is apparent VON KLUTZ 's proposal has not fallen upon deaf ears . VON KLUTZ ( smiling modestly ) It would not be difficult . Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely . Greenhouses could maintain plant life . Animals could be bred and slaughtered . A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country , but I should n't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd . Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY But who would be chosen ? VON KLUTZ A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed , but off-hand , I should say that in addition to the factors of youth , health , sexual fertility , intelligence , and a cross-section of necessary skills , it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included , to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition . The arrow has not missed its mark , and there is an outbreak of sober , nodding heads . VON KLUTZ ( laughs , distastefully ) Naturally , they would breed prodigiously , eh ? There would be much time and little to do . With the proper breeding techniques , and starting with a ratio of , say , ten women to each man , I should estimate the progeny of the original group of 200,000 would emerge a hundred years later as well over a hundred million . Naturally the group would have to continually engage in enlarging the original living space . Much serious judgment is brought to bear around the table . Pencils are brought into action . VON KLUTZ When they emerge , a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable , if they are moth-balled in advance . I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY But , look here , Von Klutz . Wo n't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked , grief-stricken , and anguished that they will envy the dead , and indeed , not wish to go on living ? VON KLUTZ Certainly not , sir . When they go down into the mine , everyone else will still be alive . They will have no shocking memories , and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those VON KLUTZ ( Cont ) left behind , combined with a spirit of bold curiousity for the adventure ahead . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( judiciously ) You mentioned the ratio of ten women to each man . Would n't that necessitate abandoning the so-called monogamous form of sexual relation- ship ? VON KLUTZ Regrettably , yes . But it is a sacrifice required for the future of the human race . I hasten to add that since each man will be required to perform prodigious service along these lines , the women will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics , which will have to be of a highly stimulating order . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( enthusiastically ) Von Klutz , I must confess you have an astonish- ingly good idea there . VON KLUTZ ( correctly ) Thank you , sir . AMBASSADOR DE SADE rises . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( briskly ) And now , Mister President , I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( shaking hands ) Goodbye , Mister Ambassador . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( at the door ) We have many splendidly deep mines in our country . He exits . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( thoughtfully ) Mister President , I think we 've got to look into this thing from the military point of view . I mean , if the enemy stashed away some big bombs and we did n't , when they come out in a hundred years , they could take over . GENERAL FACEMAN That 's right , sir . In fact , they might even try a quick , sneak attack , so they can take over our mine-shaft space . ADMIRAL BULDIKE They might even try to knock over a couple of other countries and take their mine-shaft space . If they had more mine-shaft space than we did , they could breed more , and possibly take over when they come out . GENERAL SCHMUCK We must not allow a mine-shaft gap ! ! The phone rings . ADMIRAL BULDIKE picks it up . ADMIRAL BULDIKE Hello ? ... Yes , just a minute . ( to GENERAL SCHMUCK ) It 's personal . GENERAL SCHMUCK takes the phone . GENERAL SCHMUCK ( charmingly ) Yes ? ... Well , pretty soon , dear . Yes , I 've finished my business . Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ... ( laughs ) Yes , dear . Same here . Bye-bye . Hangs up the phone . There is a knock at the door . Enter AMBASSADOR DE SADE . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( haughtily ) Excuse me , Mister President , but you forgot to give me my camera back . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( fishes in pocket for Minox ) Oh , yes , that 's right . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK Just a second , sir . He 's got films of the War Room in that thing ! PRESIDENT MUFFLEY I 'm afraid I 'll have to ask you to take the film out . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( annoyed ) Very well . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK You know , sir , that camera might be a dummy he wanted us to find . He 's probably got another one secreted on his person . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( sputtering ) That 's utterly ridiculous . GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK He 's been here for almost two hours , and Lord knows what he 's photographed . I 'd have him stripped and give a thorough body search . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( appalled ) That 's preposterous ! I object ! ! The PRESIDENT thinks for a moment . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( reassuringly ) I 'm afraid we 'll have to - purely as a formality , Ambassador de Sade . Zlat , will you call the Secret Service and have them prepare a private room upstairs for a body search . The AMBASSADOR is shocked and angry . AMBASSADOR DE SADE Please , Mister President , I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation . Here is the only other camera I have left . ( he produces a second camera ) GENERAL SCHMUCK See ! See , I told you . PRESIDENT MUFFLEY ( shaking his head ) You 've lied to me twice - I 'm sorry , but it will be strictly routine . These men are experts . GENERAL SCHMUCK Zlat , make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( horrified ) My seven body orifices ? ? ? ? GENERAL SCHMUCK That 's right , fella . AMBASSADOR DE SADE ( touches ears ) One , two ... ( touches each nostril ) three , four ... ( touches mouth ) five ... ( freezes , turns red and swallows hard ) Why you , dirty , stinking ... AMBASSADOR DE SADE picks up a thick custard pie from among a large selection of pies previously brought into the room with coffee , and smashes it into GENERAL SCHMUCK 's angry face . GENERAL SCHMUCK hurls a coconut cream pie at DE SADE , who ducks . It splatters into the face of ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE . Not realizing why he has been hit , ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE flings a chocolate cream pie at GENERAL `` BUCK '' SCHMUCK . It misses and plops into PRESIDENT MUFFLEY 's face . And , as is the case with the great-pie throwing scenes , misunderstand- ing piles upon misunderstanding , until everyone in the room is hectic- ally engaged in splattering pies into each other 's face .

1936;Justin , your carriage is waiting . All right , all right . One moment . Dr. Francois Yes ? Might ? No , justice ! In what way did he wrong you ? He killed my wife ! With his very hands . He gave her fever . Childbed fever . But you ca n't blame a doctor for that . Yes . Read this . Louis Pasteur . Now who is he ? He is a menace to science The shooting of Dr. Francois proves it . Now , monsieurs If Pasteur is allowed to continue He will make the practice of medicine unsafe for us physicians and surgeons of France . You have all read the pamphlet . Louis Pasteur He is n't even a doctor , sire . He 's a mere chemist . A chemist You do n't say . You remember a few years ago he was the cause of a slight controversy on the subject of sour wine . Oh yes . I recall . He claimed to have found little animals in it Infinitesimal beasts . But are there such creatures ? Do they really exist ? Your majesty , microscopic organisms have long been observed . They spring into being of their own accord . Wherever there is putrid matter or fermentation . They are the result rather than the cause of disease . By heating wine to certain temperatures , M. Pasteur was able to destroy them . I presume he plans to cure blood poisoning in the same manner . Namely by boiling our blood . Heaven forbid . It 's not unlikely I assure you . But I wo n't have it , Charbonnet . I wo n't tolerate such practices . We 're not living in the middle ages . This is France . Paris . The nineteenth century . I think M. Pasteur should be allowed to defend himself . But , your majesty ... I too have read the pamphlets , Dr. Charbonnet They said nothing about boiling blood . Merely to boil the instruments that you surgeons use . Your majesty , if I did anything so absurd as to boil my instruments or scrub my hands they 'd think I was a witchdoctor resorting to charms and laugh me out of the hospital . That would be a novelty , monsieur . Most people who go to hospitals are carried out . dead Yes , Charbonnet Why ? Because our criminal disregard of germs and their power to invade the bloodstream is causing a death rate in childbirth alone of three out of every ten mothers . Or in the city of Paris so that twenty thousand innocent and helpless women annually This being the case , gentlemen , I leave it to you to decide . which of us should be called murderer . I know what they 'll say to that . `` Give us proof . '' proof As if the dead and dying were n't proof enough for their stupidity . But , Louis You ca n't be sure . You have n't found the germs . Roux ? Yes How about those slides . Do they show anything ? Fifty eight tests . All negative . -And yours . -Here 's one . With a few short chains . Let me see it . According to Semmelweis There has never been a case of childbed fever unless the doctor or midwife had been in recent contact with another victim of the disease . What luck . Nothing definite Try again Again ? Yes , again , again and again Remember our aim . Find the microbe . Kill the microbe . Mother ? Yes , Annette ? There 's someone at the door . -Who is it ? -I do n't know . I did n't look . Service of his majesty the emperor of France A letter for M. Pasteur . He is n't here , monsieur . No ? Then who is that ? M. Pasteur . `` invitation to the palace '' The emperor . If I could only convince him . No , no , no , thank you . Now , Annette , we must hurry and get the surprise ready . -Can I help ? -We 'll all help , darling . This is n't the palace . Excuse me stopping , monsieur . One moment . My wife is very sick . The doctor warned me . Louise ! You could have done nothing , doctor . She 's been in a coma for two days . -Childbed fever ? -No doubt . A pity . It was an act of providence . Providence No , ignorance . You are going to another confinement ? Yes , monsieur . The Countess Devilleveau for Dr. Charbonnet . Please , use a clean one . Charbonnet ! Charbonnet Your majesty I have a surprise for you . Who do you think is here ? I am most curious , your majesty . Who ? Pasteur . Pasteur ? -Here at the palace ? -Yes I sent for him . The emperor has never seen a germ . He 's very skeptical . If he will honor me by looking at these slides ... M. Pasteur You are wanted . I wonder how you handle this apparatus . The empress Let me see . Oh , well Come come , Pasteur , tell us precisely what you mean . Sire The hospitals of Paris are pest houses . There 's scarcely a doctor in the city who 's not carrying death on his hands and instruments . Because of microbes , monsieur ? Your private menagerie of invisible beasts ? Exactly . Dr. Charbonnet could see them for himself . If he took the trouble to use his microscope . He could watch them multiply into murderous millions . They breed in filth . They may start from the gutters of Paris tonight and by tomorrow claim some mother from this very court . Preposterous ! To think that a human being could be destroyed by an animal ten thousand times smaller than a flea . It 's as though an army of ants were to overthrow your majesty 's empire . Monsieur A young woman the wife of one of the court servants died here this evening . A victim of your bigotry . You dare accuse me of murder ? But that is n't the end . The midwife who attended her will carry the infection to your next and more illustrious patient Countess Gabrielle Devilleveau Stop ! You should know better , monsieur . The Countess Gabrielle is her majesty 's sister . I forbid any more . Oh , M. Pasteur , it 's most fascinating If you please , my dear . Your majesty , I ... Is it not true that you are the author of a pamphlet which caused the death of a noted physician ? And also that you practice medicine of a kind ? I do n't practice medicine . I 'm trying to put a stop to the negligence of those who do . Pasteur In the preservation of wine and beer you have been of service to France . We appreciate it . In the future you will confine your work to that field . It is my wish , nay , my command . And if you have any more theories to offer you will first present them in writing to the Academy of Medicine . which is the proper guardian of our national health . Sire What about the pamphlet he 's already written ? As for that pamphlet , monsieur You will publish an immediate retraction or suffer my displeasure . Permit me , monsieur . I 'm Jean Martel , physician and surgeon . Graduate of the Institute Frances doctor of medicine from Le Sorbonne Secretary of Hygiene , member of the International Association of Doctors at Edinburgh Personally , I 'm convinced there is some truth in what you say You honor me . Charbonnet is a fool when it comes to anything new or the least bit ... I beg your pardon . Are n't you Dr. Charbonnet 's assistant ? Yes I suppose I am . It 's your duty to respect him then . Not to ridicule him . I , monsieur ? Good night . He 's coming ! -He 's coming . -Light the candles -Light the candles quickly -Light the candles Stop that . Marie You have to pack . We 're leaving Paris tomorrow . You all are aware of the conditions upon which Bismark has consented to withdraw the German armies from France In addition to forfeiting Alsace-Lorraine we must pay an immediate indemnity of five billion francs The question is how are we to raise such a sum ? Your excellency Our industries are at a standstill . Farms are being neglected . A devastating plague destroys our cattle at a cost of millions of francs annually This being the case my efforts to raise money have failed everywhere except in one small province . the district of Arbois But if Arbois can pay why not the others ? For some reason they have n't been affected by the plague Is that true , Dr. Radisse ? I do n't know , your excellency . If there is no disease in the cattle of Arbois it is our duty to learn why . Perhaps they 've found some means of preventing it . Your excellency , every farmer has a so called cure for anthrax The Academy of Science has listened to thousands How do you account for this phenomenon ? Sometimes it happens a few would be immune . Arbois , it seems is particularly fortunate . That is only guesswork , Dr. Radisse . I suggest that you make a thorough investigation immediately . France is in desperate need . Her resources must be tapped to the limit . Every animal that you can save for slaughter will buy back some Frenchman's liberty and self respect They really do n't look sick . Luck , that 's all , pure luck . Let 's ask that boy a few questions . Come on , come please . Hello there , young man . hello Have any of your animals died of anthrax lately ? Anthrax ? What 's that ? You know . The Black Plague . Oh , Black Plague . They used to but not any more . Just as I thought . These fields have become immune . But how , doctor ? Why ? My dear friend , that question is beyond the scope of science . When you ask me how or why , I must refer you to the theologian . When the sheep were sick did your master do anything to help them ? He could n't do much for the sick ones . But there 's a man who does something for the others . And they stay well . Like these here . What man ? See that house over there by the bridge ? -Yes ? -He lives there I beg your pardon . I 'm Jean Martel . This is Dr. Radisse . Chairman of the agricultural board of the new republic . Well Oh , visitors . See here . What is this nonsense ? Monsieur ? What do you think you 're doing to those sheep ? Vaccinating them against the anthrax bacillus . -The what ? -The microbe , monsieur . The germ that causes anthrax . Do you hear that , Martel ? The germ . We were sent to Arbois to discover , if possible , why your sheep escaped the plague . You 're quite welcome , monsieur . My name is Annette . Annette Pasteur . You . You mean ... I 'm quite sure Father would be delighted to see you . Not Louis Pasteur . That , that chemist ? Father Louis Now where are you going ? Did n't you promise me to rest ? I 'll be right back , dear . Be right back . So you are now the saviour of the sheep , monsieur ? Very interesting He 's the man who was responsible for the death of Dr. Francois Remember ? He was run out of Paris . Not quite , doctor . Do n't deny it . You were . And you were warned not to practice . Positively forbidden . A prophet is never without followers it seems . But rarely such intelligent ones . These animals know what 's good for them . Perhaps you will tell me what 's good for them . I 'd like to know too . I 'm afraid it 's hopeless but I 'll try . Roux ? Yes ? Will you try and explain to Dr. Radisse what we 're doing ? He 's a member of the Academy of Medicine . So you 'll have to use very simple language . We 're convinced , doctor , after eight years of experimenting that this vaccine when injected into the animal will set up an immunity . Ridiculous . It would take eighty years to convince me . Eighty ? Are n't you a little optimistic ? You 're wasting your money . But I do n't pay . It 's free . Bah ! Come along , Martel . I 've heard enough . Are you coming ? No . I 'm going to stay . Drive on . Still disobeying your superiors , eh ? I did n't think you remembered me , monsieur . I remember you indeed . The night at the palace when I told the emperor Countess Devilleveau would die . You were right . She did die . And Charbonnet has never forgiven you . May I ask why you want to stay ? I 'm no longer an idle courtier , monsieur . I work for the government . My job is to help the farmers of France . So So if you do n't mind ... -Annette -Yes , Father ? Ask your mother if we have room for a guest . Oh , I 'm quite sure we have . I mean I 'll go find out . So you want to render your country a real service , is that it ? Why , yes I do . Good . Come with me . This should be of interest to you . I have here the complete life history of the anthrax bacillus in a form even the layman can understand . For example , this slide reveals a number of dormant germs or spores , as we call them which are found in the grass and soil wherever diseased animals have been buried . In this state the germ hibernates , so to speak the way a caterpillar does in a cocoon . And they remain inanimate for years . But the moment these germs find themselves in a favorable medium such as the warm blood of a sheep they immediately change form and grow into long rods . Like this . Amazing ! Let us now look at the blood of a healthy animal . Before any germs have entered it . Those are living blood cells as we find them in a normal healthy sheep . How do the spores get into the bloodstream ? They 're swallowed with the grass that the creature eats . But soon we find that the spores have changed into fully developed germs . Deadly and prolific . Here we have the blood of a sick animal . This time with the anthrax bacillus present . Note the rods that occur among the cells Those are the culprits we 're fighting . At this stage , the animal is doomed to die . Once it is buried , however , the germs cease to be active and become spores again . As time goes on they 're liberated into the soil . to be blown about in the dust and pollute the grass . Hence the continued recurrence of the plague . And you say these spores are present even here ? In the pastures at Arbois ? Every acre of ground that I 've tested . The only reason our cattle stay healthy is because of my vaccine . For an animal that hasn't been vaccinated Arbois is one of the worst areas in all of France . Where are they taking these sheep ? I do n't know . Boncourt , find out where they 're going . What 's that ? Look Radisse is responsible for this . Government field . Government field . -That stupidity is inexcusable . -We must stop them Stop ! Stop them ! Stop them ! Stop ! Stop them ! We 're not letting the sick ones through . Only the healthy ones . They 'll die I tell you . The fields are n't safe . They 're raging with contagion . As a representative of the government I 've inspected these fields and they 're safe . But that 's so wrong . It 's been proven that they 're not . -stop them -come on , come on . stand back . Is n't there anyone we can appeal to ? I 've seen with my own eyes what Pasteur can do . And has done for the sheep and cattle of Arbois . We on the other hand , members of the Academy of Medicine , have contributed nothing in the fight against anthrax . Then why in heaven 's name do n't we listen to a man who has ? Pasteur was discovered to be a charlatan ten years ago when he made ludicrous claims concerning the cause of childbed fever . Claims that he was never able to prove . Consequently I see no reason for humoring him further . I disagree . If someone has a cure for anthrax I want to know about it . So do I . Will the visitors in the gallery please keep quiet . -Dr. Radisse -Thank you . There is just one question I want to raise . And that is this . Whether Dr. Martel 's purpose here is to further the cause of science or the cause of love . Personally I am of the latter opinion . For having met M. Pasteur's amiable daughter I can hardly blame our young collegue for wishing to become his son-in-law . I protest , Mr. Chairman . I 'm here because I think Pasteur is right . I know he 's right . And he will doubtless reward you for your splendid efforts on his behalf . Dr. Rossignol Friends , collegues , I should like to propose an experiment that will rid us once and for all of this medical mountebank , Louis Pasteur . In my laboratory I found that I can produce anthrax in healthy sheep by injecting into them the dark poisonous blood of an animal already affected with the disease . This treatment invariably results in death . Let us take fifty normal healthy sheep twenty five of which will be vaccinated by M. Pasteur the other twenty five will remain as they are . I shall then infect all fifty sheep with anthrax by the method I 've just explained . And i defy any man or any vaccine to save one of them . -Splendid ! -Nonsense ! Pasteur would be a fool to try it . He would n't dare . Dr. Martel Well , I ... I ca n't take it upon myself . Well , if this treatment is all that you say it is -Yes , let him prove it , let him prove it -I dare him to try it . I accept . M. Pasteur Thank you . -Dr. Rossignol -One moment , please . Just Dr. Rossignol , please . This is the last one . If you wait for me , I 'll go home with you Do n't you have to stay here ? Oh no . No , that 's against the rules of the experiment . Then Father can go home with us too ? yes Having treated these twenty five animals with your magic vaccine your contention is that they are now immune ? correct And I am at liberty to inject into them the blood of an animal that has died of anthrax ? If you insist , doctor . But it 's a very clumsy way of introducing the disease . Much simpler if you use the germ instead . Who said anything about germs ? Well , what do you think causes anthrax ? Anthrax is generated within the body . It does not come from an outside source Well , why inject anything ? -Why not let it generate ? -Monsieur Are you going to abide by the rules of this experiment ? Or would you rather admit your defeat here and now ? Proceed , doctor . By all means , proceed . -It merely occurred to me -Too many things occur to you . That 's your trouble . We 're ready , doctors . Oh . Go ahead . I say , M. Pasteur would you care to make a statement to the London Times ? The sheep that have not been treated by me will die of anthrax within forty eight hours . The others wo n't even be ill , I suppose . At least let us hope they wo n't . For the sake of France . To the end of microbes . And their high priest , Louis Pasteur . Try not to worry , Louis I should have stayed . I should n't have left them . Who 's there ? Besides Dr. Rossignol said it was against the rules . Rules . what nonsense . Louis You realize what this means ? Tomorrow if you 're successful , every farmer in Europe will want your vaccine You wo n't have a moment 's peace day or night . The benefits of science are not for scientists , Marie . They 're for humanity . Our opponents are on their way . Well , Rossignol or Pasteur . Which is it going to be ? I say Rossignol . He 's a member of the academy . I say M. Pasteur will win . Please , one moment . Well , they 're having quite a crowd . It 's amazing . People have come from all over Europe To see the acrobats or the Punch and Judy show ? These rural entertainers are like fleas the slightest crowd attracts them . Thank you , monsieur . Dr. Lister , one moment , please . Lister ? Well , well . Dr. Lister from England ? The press would appreciate a statement Lister . How extraordinary . What brings you here ? The same reason that brings you , my friends . How do you do . Please -I 'm sorry . After you . -No , after you . -After you . -No , after you . -Dead . -Yes . -Pasteur was right . -So far . Now let 's see the ones he treated . Well , they wo n't die , eh ? You could n't convince me . They 're all alive and healthy . As you predicted . Roux Roux My faithful friend . Let me shake your hand . Father , Father , I 'm so happy . And I 'm so proud , dear . Annette Jean , is n't this wonderful ? At last , monsieur , a triumph ! For you too , my boy . Congratulations . Father ? Jean has something to ask you . Well , let him ask . M. Pasteur , what I wanted to say was Yes ? M. Pasteur Since my arrival at Arbois I have come to know you and your family quite well . And M. Pasteur ... Yes , well , well ? Well , I feel ... Father ? Jean is trying to ask you for my hand . Yes , we want to be married . Well , I should hope so . Congratulations It does n't seem possible . How can they be alive ? I ca n't understand it either . It 's very easy to understand . Pasteur was right and we were wrong . His vaccine does prevent anthrax . We have a great man in our midst . A great man . I quite agree . I forsee marvelous benefits for the world . Especially in the field of surgery . Why not tell Pasteur yourself , Dr. Lister ? I 'd be delighted to . I want to meet him . Oh , here he is now . Pardon me . Excuse me . Look at those eyes sparkling with health . M. Pasteur If I 've been skeptical , I I beg of you to forgive me . It 's a miracle . Thank you , thank you . Dr. Lister . He wants to meet you . He 's travelled all the way from England . I feel it a great honor to be present . The honor is mine , doctor . I 'm well acquainted with the work you 're doing in antiseptics . Thanks to you and your brilliant leadership . Such is fame . Mad dog ! Mad dog ! Mad dog ! He bit me ! Take him to the blacksmith 's . See ? This is one . Make ten of none . Count two and three before let be . Come five and six the witch 's fix . late seven and eight , this can be straight And nine is one and ten is none . And this is the witch 's once once one . No ! Not all the doctors in Europe could do more for him . He 'll be lucky if he doesn't get rabies even now . And yet if we could find the cause . The cause of rabies , doctor . Perhaps a cure would follow . There must be a way . Mother Annette At this hour Why does n't Jean come home ? -He 's working with father . -But he 's my husband . Bu dear , he has n't forgotten that . Science , science Everything 's science . I 'm going to have a baby . Does n't he realize that ? When I was your age , I had babies but I did n't cry about it . Yes , and how many of them lived ? Annette Oh , Mother , I 'm so frightened . Now , now I want to see Father . I want to talk to him . You 'll alarm him needlessly . Are n't you ashamed ? You know how easily worried he is . Where is M. Pasteur ? He ca n't be disturbed just now . What is it ? It 's about the veterinarian . You wait here . I 'll speak to him . It does n't work . Nothing works . We 've been following the same procedure that we did with anthrax . Which only shows how little we know about disease . Nature 's far too subtle to repeat herself . I 'm sorry , Jean , darling . You 're in the middle of an experiment . I did n't mean to disturb you . It 's all right , dear . You better go back . Father might need you . In a while . I 'll see you home . It wo n't be necessary . I have the coach with me . Attention , all of you . So far we 've been unable to find the microbe that causes rabies . Yet our experiments have shown that it exists . Now listen carefully . As soon as the veterinarian comes wait Where 's Martel ? Just a moment , please . Martel ! Martel -Good night , dear . -Good night . -Good night -Martel Martel coming -Where is he ? What is he doing ? -Annette was here . Annette ? -How is she ? -She 's all right . It 's eleven o'clock , Louis . Now what about your supper ? Oh , a minute , dear . Just a minute . You said a minute three hours ago and you 've eaten nothing . And we could all do with a little supper , I think . well All right . Tell them to stop . but We 're to resume in half an hour . -Cecile -yes , Madam Supper Hello There you are . That 's the veterinarian . Open the door . -Louis ? -Yes ? I have a letter for you . It came by special post from England . From Dr. Lister . Let me see it . Not until you 've eaten . -Oh , but it 's important , Marie . -Very well . I 'll read it to you . Dear , sir My observations lead me to believe you are a scoundrel . What ? I 'm told you are a slave driver to your assistants . That you neglect your wife , abuse your family This is no time to joke . No . Not until you 've eaten . I 'll tell you what he said . My dear Pasteur , That 's different . Your recent paper on the known sources of infection is admirable in every detail . Forgive the frankness with which a common love of science inspires me . I embrace you . My fellow workers in Brussels and Prague have reported that their hospitals are rapidly becoming safe . Mothers can go to them without fear . That 's where Annette should be sent for her confinement . These doctors in Paris That is n't all he says . I do not hesitate to acclaim you the most valuable man yet to enter the field of science . it 's nothing , Marie It 's a dog . A mad dog . Open his mouth . I want to get as much of it as I can . Steady now . Louis Louis , stop ! -Not hydrophobia . -Marie I 've pledged myself to find a cure . I ca n't stop now . Not until I 've exhausted every effort to rid the world of this deadly disease . M. Pasteur refuses to attend our meeting But he continues to impose on the credulity of the people . Too often has he touted the columns of the papers with his theories . What about his vaccine for anthrax ? That 's not a theory . It 's a fact . It not only elected him to this academy But it helped our poor farmers save enough money to pay for the entire Franco-Prussian war . In the name of French science Science ? You abuse the word . I stand here to defend the honor of French medicine against the tricks of a charlatan . Dr. Zaranoff I am a Prussian . I came here for a different purpose . Commissioned by my government to investigate Pasteur 's efforts . His fame has spread to the peasantry of my country who for centuries have been preyed upon by rabid wolves . I have spent all my life studying rabies or hydrophobia as we call it . And monsieurs I would worship I would kneel to any man who would point the way to a cure . I deny that miccrobes can be the cause of rabies or any other disease . Dr. Charbonnet How do we know that bacteria are not harmful ? How do we know they do not do their deadly work as Pasteur claims ? If Pasteur is not willling to come to us let us go to Pasteur . To be humiliated further ? You , I , the whole academy ? Humility is a virtue , monsieur . Not only in those who suffer but in those who hope to heal . All right , let us go . Let us see what this great man can teach us . Thank you , madam better Fortunately we found you in , monsieur . It 's the wish of some that the Academy of Medicine honor you . Honor me ? And to be brief Dr. Zaranoff here has been reading your recent statements in the journal . How do you do , doctor ? Promising a cure for rabies . The press takes liberties , doctor . As usual , my remarks were grossly exaggerated . In other words , you have no grounds for making such a prediction ? -Grounds ? -Proof No not yet I did n't think so . What an odor ! In your last paper to the academy , monsieur you stated that you were on the threshold of a vast new world . Might I inquire if you've crossed that threshold ? Science takes a step then another then it stops and reflects before taking a third . A mother takes a nursing child , puts it down , says , `` walk '' The child takes the first step . then another then it stops unsteadily . Would the mother be right to say to him , `` You are hesitating. '' ? You will never walk ? Put out that pipe . It stinks to high heaven . You were saying . Step by step , I 'm reaching the ultimate conclusion . That microbes are the cause of all disease . If you men are still skeptical if microbes are still a myth to you then listen . One drop of this rabies virus on the slightest scratch will kill a man . I hold enough in my hands to wipe out a whole city . Ridiculous ! To think that this could kill a man . All I want now is to have you predict the hour of my death . It 's over a month now and he 's still in perfect health . Really . -I saw him here yesterday -You did ? Oh , here he comes now . -Hello , Charbonnet . How are you today ? -Splendid . Never felt better . According to Pasteur , you ought to be in your grave . The more germs I take the better I feel . Cecile , please tell Monsieur that Dr. Rossignol is here . yes , madam . Something ought to be done . I 've just come from the boulevard . Charbonnet is making a laughingstock of your husband . Parading up and down , showing off doing everything he can to attract attention to himself . And ridiculing M. Pasteur . Louis does n't mind ridicule . If he thinks he 's right , that 's all that matters . M. Pasteur , I 've come to warn you about Charbonnet . You ca n't afford to be made ridiculous . The work you 're doing is too important . Important ? I wish it were . It is n't . Not yet . My results have all been negative . You have n't been able to discover the microbe ? Is that what you mean ? Not a sign . You seemed so confident the day we were here . I still am . Every animal that was inoculated with the contents of that test tube died . Charbonnet , for some reason , resisted the disease . Why I do n't know . Louis , are you sure it was the same tube ? Positive . It was the only specimen I had . You may have let it stand too long . You told me once the germs grow weaker . Less virulent with age . Wait It might be . -Roux -Yes ? How old was that virus when Charbonnet injected it into his arm ? Fourteen days . And when was it last used on the rabbit ? Oh , about a week before , I believe . A week . Are you sure ? Just a moment . Here 's the record . -Nine days to be exact . -There 's your answer . It must be . It 's the only conceivable explanation . You think by allowing the virus to age you were able to render it harmless ? Not harmless but weak . Weak enough for the system to overcome . Even if that 's true , it wo n't help you any . When a man is bitten he gets the germ full strength . Not attenuated . Precisely . But suppose we started with a fourteen day old virus that 's no longer deadly ? Suppose we injected it into a healthy animal and day by day as nature builds up its resistance we increase the dosage with stronger fresher virus Until the animal is able to withstand the actual disease that we find in the world at large . Would he not then be immune ? It would be impossible . It would never work . If the first injection did n't kill him the second would . Or the third . Roux Where are those tubes you 've been preparing ? Right here . Let me have them . They 're all in order . Each one is dated . Here we are . Fourteen days . Jean ? Yes , monsieur . -Jean , how many dogs do we have left ? -Ten Are they well , healthy ? In perfect condition . They 've never been exposed . Give them hydrophobia . You mean ? Give them hydrophobia . Open the door . There you are . There you are . Everybody gets his share . If it had n't been for Charbonnet we might never have discovered this treatment . Poor Charbonnet . Little does he know that he 's been our favorite guinea pig . Louis ? Yes , dear . Will you come , please ? There 's a doctor to see you . A doctor ? Wait a minute , wait a minute . M. Pasteur , I am Dr. Pfeiffer . I apologize for not giving you notice but we came all the way from Alsace . We ? Oh , I beg your pardon . Here they are . Madam Meister , monsieur . Her child is a patient of mine . The boy has been bitten by a dog . I have done everything I could but there is very little . -Should he develop hydrophobia -You can help him They told us you could . Give me your hand , little fellow . Do n't be afraid . I wo n't hurt you . My little boy . My little Joseph . How long has it been ? Five days . Have you cauterized the wound ? Not right away . It must have been twenty four hours . Does that mean I 'm going to die ? Of course not . Little boys do n't die . They have too much to live for . He wo n't live . He wo n't . I know he won't Last year it was the laborer 's child of ours . -Now he ... -Keep quiet ! -What does that have to do with you ? -Oh , save him ! Save him , save him ! Marie Put him to bed and see that he 's kept warm . There now You must n't be frightened . We 'll go upstairs , shall we ? You must be tired after all that long journey . -Mother -I 'm coming , darling . I 'm coming . Are you quite sure the dog was rabid ? Beyond a doubt . I made the test myself . Is there anything you can do ? I do n't know . I 'm just experimenting . I have hopes but I ... Roux Find Dr. Rossignol for me at once . What harm in this is there , Dr. Rossignol ? I 'm sorry . Since death is the only alternative for the boy I would be willing to try anything . Would n't you , Dr. Rossignol ? I 'm sorry . I ca n't agree . Much as I admire Pasteur 's accomplishments . Nevertheless , when human life is at stake I 'd have to take a long while before going contrary to the best medical knowledge . Which in this case means to let the boy die . We do what we can , administer drugs , sedatives Is there a single cure of hydrophobia on record ? I 'm not arguing for it . I 'm merely pointing out what the accepted treatment happens to be . To embark upon a new course is always dangerous . From a professional point of view . And it would be doubly so for M. Pasteur who is a chemist not a doctor . And could expect no support from the medical profession . For his sake , therefore , I strongly advise That nothing irregular be attempted . Good evening , monsieurs . You 're not going to listen to him , are you ? Do n't misunderstand me . My treatment has saved dogs . Ten of them . But I have n't the faintest notion what effect it would have upon a human being . If I failed It would mean prison perhaps the guillotine . If you change your mind , I beg of you , let me know . Good night . Louis You did n't . They 'll put you in prison . They 'll put you in prison . He 's asleep . Good morning , Jean . Good morning , madam . Any news of Annette ? Seems to me the time is drawing near . That 's what I want to talk to you about . The doctor I 've been counting on is ill. -LeClaire ? -Yes I 'm sure Louis will find someone to take his place . Yes , but when it comes to the use of antiseptics It 's very difficult to find anyone you can trust . Martel Yes , monsieur . How is the boy ? He has a fever . The third injection made him ill. Is Roux with him ? What are you going to do now ? Do ? Give him a fourth . A fifth . A sixth . If he lives . Is that test finished ? -No , not quite . -Why not ? What 's wrong ? One of the vials was accidentally broken . Idiots ! Clumsy fools . I will not stand for it . Do you hear ? Do it yourself . Very well . Do n't let another soul touch it . Louis You have n't closed your eyes in forty eight hours . There 'll be time enough later . But there wo n't . That 's just the trouble . You 'll go on and on . Marie I 've been lucky all my life . Luckier than I deserved . But if i fail now You wo n't fail . The boy will recover . And when he does , we 'll go away . We 'll take a long vacation . Martel , Roux All of them . They need it more than we do . How fine they 've been . How patient . They 'll never know how grateful I am . -Why do n't you should tell them ? -I will . I will . And you , Marie ... You , most of all . What have I done to warrant such devotion ? Do you remember what you said when you asked me to marry you ? You said , There 's nothing about me to attract a young girl 's fancy . But those who 've known me very well have come to like me . Did I say that ? Was I really that vain ? You knew better too . You were looking in a mirror when you said that . This way , please . A thousand pardons for intruding . I just came from the Russian embassy . Look out the window . Look . They are peasants . Victims of rabid wolves . My government has sent them to you . So soon ? Madam , your husband 's cure's the talk of the country . But it has n't been proven yet . That 's why they 're here . To offer themselves for the test , Pasteur . It 's a marvelous oppotunity . Yes , a marvelous oppotunity . To kill ! To murder . Stay away , Louis . Do n't let them see you . Pasteur I 'm a scientist , Zaranoff , not a magician . My treatment was intended for dogs . But these are men . Pasteur , think of it . Surely you wo n't refuse . Pasteur , Pasteur , Pasteur Take them to the hospital . Isolate them . I want a full report on every case . Thank you , monsieur , thank you . More than life . What a triumph Good day , madam . A thousand pardons . Good day , doctor . Madam ? Yes , Cecile . How 's the boy ? The same . He 's had the injection . That makes four . -Roux -Yes ? Tell the men they 're not to leave the laboratory under any circumstances . Is that clear ? -I may need them at a moment 's notice . -Very well . Now madam , what should I tell the coachman ? Is he still here ? -He 's waiting in the kitchen . -Just a moment . Louis It 's Annette and Dr. LeClaire is ill. -LeClaire ill ? -I think I better call Jean . Not a word to Jean . -Jean stays here . -Louis -He 's her husband . -The work he 's doing must be finished . But what are we going to do ? Do n't worry . I 'll see she gets the proper care . Is the doctor in ? Dr. Ferrare is out on a case . He wo n't be home until midnight . Midnight . Is Dr. Zomia in I 'm very sorry , monsieur , but the doctor 's gone to the Riviera for a month 's vacation he was here last time -Is there any message ? -No , no , thank you . Dominic , hold on . I want to speak to you I want to speak to you . I need help . My daughter's having a child . Splendid but why come to me ? Is she all right ? This is my wife , Dr. Charbonnet . She will help you . -You can depend on her . -Madam , I am deeply honored . Charbonnet ? Cecile , boil some water . I 'll go back to Annette . A large kettle full . You 're not going to use those instruments without boiling them ? Certainly . I wo n't permit it . My dear Pasteur , I 'm doing this as a professional courtesy . Do it my way . Please . All right . I 'll do it your way . But I 'll make a bargain with you . A bargain ? I , Louis Pasteur , hereby acknowledge If I live another month without contracting hydrophobia I shall be priveledged to publish this in the leading scientific journals of Europe . -Keep them boiling Yes , monsieur . -Where 's the patient ? -Wait , wait . Wash your hands first . Take it all off . Now roll up your sleeves . Wash them to the elbows . What 's that ? Do n't be afraid . It 's only a little bichloride . Now use the brush . The brush , the brush . Louis Yes , yes . In a moment . There . Does that suit you Yes . That 's better . Now there 's a clean towel over there . Cecile , hurry . You may go in now . My daughter 's ready . Do n't touch it ! What ? Your hands . Your hands . You 've spoiled it now . You 'll have to wash them again . See here . I 've brought hundreds of babies into the world . Remember our bargain . Do as I say . Such foolishness . Now , hold them up high . What next ? Touch nothing but the patient . What about my instruments ? They 'll be brought to you . Louis Louis , we have a grandson . A grandson . Louis Dr. Charbonnet , come quickly . My husband 's ill. Louis . Louis . He 's had a stroke . My My left side is paralyzed ? Only slightly . It 's nothing serious . When did it happen ? A few days ago . A few days . You were more tired than anything else . Feeling better ? The Meister boy . He 's doing splendidly . Thank God . And The Russians . Have you been able to help them ? The hospital refused to allow our treatment without permission from the academy . The permission was granted this morning . But it was too late , Three of them died yesterday . Horribly -Let me up . -Please , Louis . I must go . How many are left ? Nineteen . But it 's no use . It 's hopeless . If our efforts can save one it will be well worth it . Let me up , someone . Get me dressed . What 's going on , doctor ? Pasteur himself is going to treat the Russians . But I 'm afraid it 's too late . -Dr. Charbonnet , why do n't you come in ? -I do n't want to disturb him . Patient number one three cc's Jean Patient number two Dr. Charbonnet I did n't thank you for delivering my grandchild . You 've been ill , monsieur . I 'm sorry . Perhaps this note will help speed your recovery . A bargain 's a bargain . I want the Pasteur treatment for hydrophobia . How are they today ? Much better . That 's good . Nineth day , patient number one . -Any change ? -Not this morning . Continue treatment . -Eight day old virus ? -Yes . Patient number five . How are the Russian patients today ? Doing very well . Pasteur makes his final visit tomorrow . Good morning , doctor . Good morning , madam . How is my little Joseph this morning ? He 's fine and such an appetite . Go right in . He 's gone . He 's gone . Joseph You little rascal you . Now get dressed . But how can we ever get Monsieur there ? I 'll take care of that part of it . He wo n't consent to go if he suspects . He wo n't suspect . You leave that to me . Marie M. Pasteur Joseph Are you ready ? Now you wait a moment . I 've a little surprise for you to take home . M. Pasteur Madam Meister wants to thank you once more before leaving . I think you are a man who will always be remembered . No , no , no , no Good bye . -Good bye -Good bye , monsieur . -Good bye . -Joseph -Can you write ? -Yes . Would you like to write to me ? Yes , very much . Then Let me hear from you every month . Wo n't you ? Yes I will . Do n't forget . I 'll be looking for your letters . Joseph ? Yes ? Thank you . -Goodbye . -Goodbye . By the way , Louis Roux 's just told me that a foreign scientist is a lecturer at the academy tonight . He claims to have disproven your entire germ theory . What ? Who is he ? What 's his name ? I do n't know . Order me a carriage . I 've got to be there . You 're just in time . Courage , dear . I 'll be listening from the balcony . Whom are they applauding ? The speaker , Dr. Lister from England . Lister ? Lister to speak against me ? Ladies and gentlemen The tribute that we render Pasteur on this occasion is small indeed compared to the countless millions who will honor his memory in generations to come . The vaccines for anthrax and hydrophobia are great accomplishments . But even greater still , I believe is the fact that thousands of people will be saved from unnecessary death from infection . And mothers need no longer fear surgery or childbirth . In the name of France I greet you . M. Pasteur I greet you in the name of humanity . Lister Great Lister From his imperial majesty The czar of all Russia with profoundest gratitude . I have no words to express . You young men doctors and scientists of the future do not let yourselves be tainted by apparent skepticism nor discouraged by the sadness of certain hours that creep over nations . do not become angry at your opponents for no scientific theory has ever been accepted without opposition . Live in the serene peace of libraries and laboratories . Say to yourselves first what have I done for my instruction . And as you gradually advance what am I accomplishing ?

This is a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy . Suddenly , something TEARS past at incredible speed : a NEUTRON STAR . It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters ... planets , stars . Can anything stop this juggernaut ? Yes . Something looms at the heart of the galaxy , hidden inside the blinding starlight , a dark flaw in the fabric of existence itself : a BLACK HOLE . The neutron star is pulled into the black hole 's swirl , spiraling closer and closer to destruction . Finally , it contacts the hole 's edge and EXPLODES . The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself . We ride one of these waves , racing back out from the black hole . Suddenly , a portion of the wave disappears down a crystallike hole , emerging in a much darker region of the universe -a backwater that , as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye , we recognize as our own . The wave , now just an infinitesimal ripple , finally reaches our blue planet . It drops into our atmosphere over North America , toward the high desert east of the Cascades , and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse . The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber , then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass . The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert . An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube . A MAN climbs out of the SUV . INT . CONTROL ROOM , WAREHOUSE -- DAY The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission Control . He pours himself a cup of coffee . It is the weekend and the place is empty . No one has been there to see the displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by a series of echoes . The man looks up at the screen , then DROPS his cup of coffee . CUT TO : 2 . * INT . LIGO OFFICES , CALTECH , PASADENA -- DAY The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity . POSTDOCS and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts , arguing . ANSEN , 60s , the director of LIGO , walks through the frenzy . A postdoc hands him a printout : a pulse followed by echoes . INT . LIGO DIRECTOR 'S OFFICE , CALTECH -- DAY Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large , sunlit office , which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech 's campus . His ASSISTANT , 30s , is on the phone , on hold . at Ansen as he enters . He looks up ASSISTANT I 'm on hold with the INS . ( covers microphone ) Do n't you think we should double check the triangulation before we call anybodyANSEN We have double checked it . Someone finally picks up the line . ASSISTANT I 'm trying to reach ( pause , listens ) No , I do n't think you understand how serious this is . ( pause ) Because if you did , we 'd be having this conversation in person . Yes . He listens for a moment , then hangs up the phone , confused . ANSEN What did they say ? ASSISTANT They said we should look out the window . Ansen steps to the window and looks out : In the courtyard below , coeds are scrambling to get out of the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his building . 3 . INT . MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM , LIGO , CALTECH -- DAY Ansen sits , alone , on one side of a conference table . The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly , some DIA . The door opens and his assistant steps in . Armed guards pat him down , then shove him into a seat . ANSEN Is that really necessary ? One of the NSA agents leans forward . NSA AGENT You 've been complaining for years that the government does n't take your project seriously enough , Doctor . ( smiles ) You ca n't have it both ways . Ansen motions to his assistant , who turns on a projector . On-screen , we see the familiar pulse and echoes . ANSEN Yesterday morning , our facility in Hanford identified this signal : a neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole . We went through the last year 's data and triangulated the source . The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron star circling into the black hole . NSA AGENT We know that , Doctor . What we don't know is why , according to your numbers , this event took place right here in our own solar system . Suddenly , the image overlays the sun , the earth , and the rest of our solar system around the black hole . ANSEN It did n't . Because if it had we'd all be dead by now . On-screen , Jupiter , then the Earth and the inner planets are consumed by the black hole . Only the sun survives , pulled into orbit around its new master . ANSEN ( CONT 'D ) Which leaves only one explanation : The signal traveled through a ( MORE ) 4 . * ANSEN ( CONT 'D ) wormhole . A gateway to a distant corner of the universe . The black hole is on the far side . On-screen , the black hole system is removed to a distant corner , connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time . A gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel . NSA AGENT I 've read your book , Doctor . You said that wormholes are impossible . ANSEN There is nothing quite as satisfying as being proved utterly wrong . ( smiles ) I said that a wormhole could n't exist naturally . Not for more than a few billionths of a second . It would have to be ... stabilized . NSA AGENT Stabilized by what ? Ansen pauses , unsure . His assistant steps in to his defense . ASSISTANT We do n't have any way to answer that question . NSA AGENT ( ignores him ) You 're not under peer review here , Doctor . I do n't care about your reputation . I need to know how that thing got there . Now . Ansen finally speaks up . ANSEN If you 're worried about an invasion , I would start drafting the articles of surrender . ( smiles ) Whoever they are , if they can build a wormhole , they could erase us in the blink of an eye . Luckily , that also means we have nothing they could be interested in . NSA AGENT Then why is it there ? 5 . ANSEN I do n't know . Maybe it 's an invitation . A chance to commune with an advanced species . The assistant , embarrassed , looks down . The agent notices . NSA AGENT You do n't agree ? ASSISTANT ( delicate ) No . I do n't think we can assume an alien intelligence built the wormhole . ( changes tack ) But the opportunity it represents is incredible . We could explore parts of the universe we never dreamt of reaching in our lifetimes . The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues , who steps out of the room . ANSEN We need to get back to work . I have a conference call with our European partners in fifteen minutes . NSA AGENT We severed the connections to your European partners this morning . ANSEN ( indignant ) You ca n't do that . The Europeans put up some of the funding ... GOVERNMENT MAN We 'll send them a check . ( stands ) Your project is now classified under the State Secrets Act . He steps out the door , leaving the men alone . outraged , turns back to his boss . ASSISTANT They ca n't keep this a secret . know that . Sooner or later ... The assistant , You The younger man looks down , embarrassed , as he notices that tears are rolling down the older man 's cheeks . 6 . ANSEN I do n't care about that . I 've spent my whole life being afraid we would wipe ourselves out before this moment arrived . We 've made so many mistakes , I was n't sure we 'd make it ... The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy . Relief . ANSEN ( CONT 'D ) But this will change everything . Fifty years from now , nothing will be the same . The older man looks at the simulation on the screen of the tiny link between our galaxy and another . FADE TO BLACK EXT . CORNFIELD , CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- DAY Corn . As far as the eye can see . SUPER TITLE : `` FIFTY YEARS LATER '' A large old diesel tour bus is parked by the side of a dirt road , smoke pouring out of its open hood . A dozen MEN in BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus . A battered PICKUP pulls up , and a MAN , 30s , gets out , leaving his two SONS in the car . This is COOPER . He joins the ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine . BALLPLAYER Seized up on us . COOPER Long way to come by bus . I thought you guys would have a plane . BALLPLAYER We did . Ran out of parts for it . You know anything about diesels ? A little . COOPER Cooper steps to the engine compartment . The ballplayer notices Cooper 's two boys , TOM , 15 , and MURPH , 10 , watching them . He wanders over . 7 . BALLPLAYER You think your dad 's going to be able to help us out ? Murph , a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye , smiles at the ballplayer . MURPH My dad can fix anything . ( wry smile ) Except maybe your fastball . The ballplayer frowns : smartass kid . After a moment under the hood , Cooper signals to the driver , who tries the engine . It turns over once , then STARTS . BALLPLAYER Sure appreciate the help . COOPER ( shrugs ) You do n't make it , my boys wo n't get to see you lose . The ballplayers load up into the bus and as it pulls away , we can see the logo painted across the back of the bus for the first time : WORLD FAMOUS NEW YORK YANKEES EXT . SPACE , NEAR EARTH ORBIT Earth spins , lazily . From this height , it looks much the same as it has done for thousands of years . Suddenly , a tiny black object appears , racing toward Earth . The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward . Behind it , the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of fragments . EXT . BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT An old minor league stadium . The stands are barely halfway full . Cooper , his boys , and Cooper 's father-in-law , DONALD , 60s , have a row to themselves behind the dugout . Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn . DONALD Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural . I want a hot dog . 8 . MURPH ( confused ) What 's a hot dog ? Suddenly , play stops on the field below as the players and fans look up at the night sky : A bright blue streak is tearing across it . It 's beautiful . TOM Is that a comet , Dad ? COOPER ( shakes his head ) Satellite . Big one . Probably Chinese . Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in the upper atmosphere . After a moment , play resumes -- it 's a pretty show , but everyone has seen it plenty of times before . Down on the field , the Dodgers ' catcher misses an easy pop fly and the Yankees load the bases . Donald looks disgusted . INT . COOPER 'S TRUCK -- NIGHT Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road . His fatherin-law is riding shotgun ; the boys are sleeping in the back . DONALD Those clowns would get their asses handed to them by the ballplayers I grew up watching . COOPER You ruin it for the boys when you talk like that . DONALD I 'm not doing my grandkids any favors by lying to them . They 're growing up watching lousy baseball . COOPER They did n't have any baseball at all when I was a kid . That shuts the old man up for now . They drive on in silence . CUT TO : 9 . EXT . FARMHOUSE -- MORNING The sun is gently landing on the horizon , painting the sea of corn around Cooper 's modest house gold . Cooper walks out of his house , still eating his breakfast . Donald is on the porch , looking at a black clouds of smoke in the distance . The neighboring fields are BURNING . DONALD Nelson 's burning up his crops . Found some of the blight on the okra . Cooper watches the men walking through the fields , setting fire to the crop . COOPER I thought okra was n't susceptible . DONALD ( shrugs ) Better safe than sorry . ( looks at him ) You 've got to take the boys to school . COOPER Something wrong with your truck ? DONALD ( smiles ) Parent-teacher conference day . Cooper bends his head in dismay . DONALD ( CONT 'D ) Be nice to Murph 's teacher . She's single , you know . COOPER What does that have to do with anything ? DONALD We 're supposed to be repopulating the earth . Got ta pull your weight . Besides , the boys could do with a woman in their lives . The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck . pulls away before Donald can continue . Cooper EXT . ROAD -- DAY Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road . The kids are arguing over an ancient comic book in the back seat . 10. Cooper turns around to break it up . BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole . EXT . ROADSIDE -- DAY Cooper examines the flattened tire . Looks at his older son . COOPER Get the spare , Tom . TOM That is the spare . COOPER We 'll use the patch kit . All right . He moves to the back of the truck . very glum . Murph suddenly looks MURPH I ... I think the patch kit might not be there ... ( off his look ) Because I was using it for my bike . Cooper looks down at the dirt . Murph 's law . Sighs . COOPER MURPH ( confused ) What 's that ? Tom snorts with laughter . Turns to his dad . TOM The kid does n't even know what he was named after ... Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough . TOM ( CONT 'D ) Murph 's law means what can go wrong will go wrong . Murph , looking hurt , walks off . Cooper turns to his son . COOPER Find something to patch it with . TOM How am I supposed to do that ? 11. COOPER Figure it out . I 'm not always going to be here to help you . Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son , who is looking out over the river . MURPH Is that really why I 'm named Murph , dad ? COOPER Listen to me . Murph 's law doesn't mean that . It means what can happen will happen . All kinds of things . Good or bad . And that 's the way you want it to be . Why ? MURPH COOPER Because if nothing ever happened to you then you would n't learn anything . Murph is staring off into the distance . Murph ? He 's heard something . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Then Cooper hears it , too . A LOW RUMBLING SOUND . Cooper looks out over the river . Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground . Suddenly , a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead , so close they can almost touch it . It bounces the truck on its suspension , then soars off over the fields behind them . Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck . He pulls a laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the back of the truck . He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph . Get in . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Tom is still standing by the side of the road , wrestling with the jack . TOM What about the tire ? INT . TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper can push it on three good tires . 12 . Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to the directional antenna . Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks , scanning the horizon . Over there- TOM To the right , the dark shape of the Russian drone appears , flying low over the fields . Cooper jerks the wheel-EXT . RIVER -- DAY The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the river and into an old , abandoned suburban housing development in the valley below , planted over with corn . Half a mile hugging the like an old tops of its in front of them , the Russian drone is still ground . It has impossibly long , skinny wings , U-2 surveillance plane , but no cockpit . The wings are covered in black solar cells . INT . TRUCK -- DAY Murph is fiddling with the computer . His older brother takes the computer from him and fires up emulation software . COOPER It 's a Chinese military drone . Solar cells could power an entire farm . ( to Tom ) Take the wheel . Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Keep it pointed right at it , OK ? Murph nods . Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop , trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone . The screen fills with Cyrillic characters . Faster , Tom . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) I 'm losing it . Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old , curved streets of the development , past oversized suburban mansions planted over with corn . They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot harvester . Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it . BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of the combine . 13 . EXT . SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY Tom guides the truck from street to street , trying to chart a straight path across the fields . The truck BOUNCES as it SMASHES through an old picket fence . Ahead , the drone is soaring , banking , pulling away . INT . TRUCK -- DAY Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone 's control circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to climb into the foothills of the Sierras . EXT . RIDGELINE , HILLS -- DAY Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills . The drone soars overhead , making for the white tips of the Sierras . INT . TRUCK -- DAY Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he concentrates on the laptop . Dad ? ( unsure ) TOM COOPER Almost got it . Do n't slow down . In front of them , Tom and his brother watch as the drone plummets from view . DAD . TOM Cooper looks up . Ahead , the trail disappears as the edge of the hills falls away -- it 's a three hundred-foot drop . Tom locks up the brakes . EXT . RIDGELINE , HILLS -- DAY The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop . Cooper climbs out , holding the laptop . Murph climbs out next to him , still pointing the Pringles can . We lost it . TOM COOPER ( smiling ) No we did n't . 14 . Suddenly , the drone SOARS back over them . Cooper types a couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad . The huge drone banks and turns in response . As the boys watch , Cooper sends the drone soaring high over them , banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the valley , light glinting from the black panels on its back . It 's a beautiful sight . Cooper crouches next to Murph . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) You want to give it a whirl ? Murph looks at his dad , wide-eyed . He takes the laptop and moves his fingers gingerly across the pad . In response , the massive plane banks into a tight turn in the valley below . For a moment , Murph is in pure heaven , sending the drone dancing through the valley below . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Set her down in the valley -- there , next to the river . Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below . EXT . ABANDONED GOLF COURSE , VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone , Cooper and the boys climb down . The valley is silent save for the truck 's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools . Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone . TOM How long do you think it 's been up there , Dad ? COOPER Chinese mission control went down same as us , twenty years ago . It's been up there ever since . TOM What was it doing flying so low ? Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop . 15. COOPER It was looking for something . Intercepted some kind of signal . ( shrugs ) It 's been at eighty thousand feet . Sun probably cooked its brain . Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access patch . He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch . Inside , surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes , is a small black module -- the drone 's auto-pilot . Cooper looks down at Murph , who is standing at his elbow . MURPH What are you going to do with it ? COOPER Reprogram it . Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor . MURPH ( quiet ) Could n't we just let it go ? not hurting anyone . Cooper looks down at his son . It's Good kid . COOPER We need all the help we can get , Murph . This thing has to adapt , just like the rest of us . Cooper gently pries the control module out . EXT . COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY It 's a small school , so all the kids and parents waiting in front know exactly who 's driving the pickup truck with half of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up . INT . PRINCIPAL 'S OFFICE , COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY Cooper is ushered into the office . The PRINCIPAL , 40s , an efficient-looking man , shakes his hand . PRINCIPAL Good to see you , Mr. Cooper . This is Ms. Kelly , Murph 's teacher . Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY , 30s , attractive . 16 . PRINCIPAL ( CONT 'D ) So we 've gotten Tom 's score back . Congratulations . He 's going to make an excellent farmer . The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper , who looks taken aback . COOPER What about college ? PRINCIPAL The University of California only accepts a few hundred students a year , Mr. Cooper . You have to be realistic . COOPER You 're ruling out college for him now ? He 's only fifteen . PRINCIPAL I 'm sorry . I 'm afraid Tom 's score simply is n't high enough . COOPER What are you , about a 36-inch waist ? ( beat ) 30-inch inseam ? PRINCIPAL I 'm not sure I see-COOPER You 're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass , but just one to measure my son 's future ? Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh , then , with a look from the principal , takes on the appropriate look of offense . PRINCIPAL I understand you 're a well-educated man , Mr. Cooper . A scientist ? Engineer . COOPER PRINCIPAL Frankly , the world does n't need any more engineers . We did n't run out of trains or television sets or satellites . ( beat ) We ran out of food . 17. Cooper leans back . He 's not going to win this one . PRINCIPAL ( CONT 'D ) The world needs farmers , Mr. Cooper . And I 'm sure your son Tom is going to make a fine one . ( smiles benignly ) We 're a caretaker generation . But things are getting better . Maybe your grandchildren will be able to attend college . Cooper looks down , swallowing his anger . Are we done ? COOPER PRINCIPAL One more thing . Ms. Kelly here says that Murph brought a book to school about the lunar landings . He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the cover across the desk to Cooper . COOPER One of my old textbooks . the pictures . Murph liked MS. KELLY This is one of the old federal textbooks . We 've replaced them with corrected versions . Corrected ? COOPER MS. KELLY The new textbooks explain that the Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union . COOPER You do n't believe we went to the moon ? MS. KELLY I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda . The Soviets spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines . COOPER '' Useless machines '' ? 18. Cooper looks to the Principal for help . None is forthcoming . MS. KELLY Yes , Mr. Cooper . The kind of wastefulness and excess that the 20th century represented . Your children would be better off learning about this planet , rather than reading fantasies about leaving it . Cooper is silent for a long moment . COOPER One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI . If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife 's brain before she died , rather than afterwards . And then my kids could have been raised by two parents , instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather . Ms. Kelly 's face falls , ashen . Most of it , anyway . Cooper swallows his anger . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) You ever consider the best thing for the world and humanity might have been for us to part company ? Cooper gets up to leave . INT . TRUCK , COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY Cooper climbs into the truck , trying to hold it together . He PUNCHES the wheel . The radio KEYS to life . He ignores it . Sits for a moment in misery . Finally he picks up the handset . CB OPERATOR ( O.S . ) Got a call from Riggs , down in Galveston . Says some of the tractors you built him went haywire last night . COOPER Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes . CB OPERATOR ( O.S . ) I did . He wants you to come down in person anyway . Says he found something you should take a look at . 19. Cooper stares at the wheel . Shakes his head in frustration . EXT . AIRSTRIP -- DAY Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar . a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub . Checks it over . Pulls INT . PIPER CUB -- DAY Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach . The radio crackles to life . COOPER Bravo-two-eight , requesting permission to enter your airspace . AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ( O.S . ) Permission granted . Welcome to the sovereign nation of Texas . Coop hangs up the radio . Banks the plane inland . EXT . GULF COAST -- DAY Below , a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes , trying to reach the beach , its wheels struggling for traction in the soft sand . A MAN waves up at Cooper 's plane as it circles overhead . Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway . Jumps down . He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past , trying to reach the dunes . He pops open the cabin . Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike the one he ripped out of the drone . He checks the fault code and resets the computer . The man jogs over to meet him . RIGGS Thanks for coming down . Half of 'em took off last night , looking for something . ( points to dunes ) Looks like they found it , too . I thought you were the man to see it . Riggs starts walking up the dune . Cooper follows . Below , on the beach , a dozen more combines and other farming vehicles are lined up at the tideline , warm gulf water lapping at their metal flanks . They are circling a deep crater . 20 . As they watch , an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself , trying to reach the crater . EXT . CRATER 'S EDGE , BEACH -- DAY Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down into the crater . At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL , about a foot across -the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a satellite . Every few seconds , it emits a distinctive CHIRP . Cooper checks his rad meter . A tiny reading -- non-lethal . He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs . Then he slides down into the hole . The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it . rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk . He RIGGS ( from above ) You think it 's an alien ? Cooper wipes sand off of the object , revealing the faint , familiar outline etched into the side of the probe : The stars and stripes of the old federal government . Not exactly . COOPER EXT . CRATER 'S EDGE , BEACH -- DAY Using a rope and a winch , Cooper hauls the blackened probe out of the crater and onto the beach . Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane . COOPER Space probe . Never seen one like it , though . Looks like it 's been to hell and back . The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back . RIGGS How do you think it wound up here ? COOPER Lost , I guess . Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago . Cooper looks at the probe for a second , admiring its form . 21 . INT . KITCHEN , COOPER 'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat of chowder . He turns to watch Cooper work , amused . The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table . Cooper works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH . Cooper gives up -- the torch has n't made a scratch . The probe CHIRPS . COOPER Well I do n't know what the hell it's made of , but I ca n't crack it open . DONALD Good . Clear it off the table so I can serve dinner . Tom and Murph walk in . Murph 's got another black eye . DONALD ( CONT 'D ) What happened this time ? MURPH I got suspended . Paul said anyone who believed we went to the moon was an idiot . So I hit him . Good boy . COOPER Hand me the scanner . Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he 's modified for the purpose . He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the probe and turns on the power . Numbers flash across the screen . the controls and it PULSES . Cooper hits a button on COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Here we go . Standard NASA encryption . Memory 's been damaged . Just noise . Hold on . I 've got something . Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into the defibrillator . After a moment , an image fills the screen : An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system impossibly dense with stars . Murph stares , transfixed . MURPH Where is that , dad ? COOPER I do n't know . Cooper looks at the probe . 22. COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Where the hell did you come from ? Cooper shrugs . Turns off the monitor . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) We 'll take it down to Tyson 's tomorrow and have it melted down . Might be some copper inside . MURPH But what about its mission ? What about the information onboard ? COOPER There 's no one for it to report to . NASA is all gone . I 'm sorry , son . It got home too late . Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot unceremoniously onto the table . INT . DINING ROOM -- NIGHT The boys have gone to bed . Cooper and Donald are alone at the table . Donald hands Cooper another beer . DONALD I heard your meeting at the school did n't go so well . Cooper shakes his head in disgust . COOPER Maybe it 's better for everyone to forget what they did back then . Reminds us how far we 've fallen . DONALD ( looks down , ) When I was kid , it felt like they made something new every day . Some gadget or idea . ( smiles ) Like every day was Christmas . ( beat ) But we made a lot of mistakes . Six billion people . Just try to imagine that . Every last one of them trying to have it all . Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands . 23 . DONALD ( CONT 'D ) The truth is this world is n't that bad . In a lot of ways its better . Tom will be all right , whether he goes to college or not . COOPER It does n't bother me that he can't go . It bothers me that he doesn't care . DONALD Tom is n't the problem . He fits in this world just fine . You 're the one who does n't fit , Coop . You don't belong here . You were born forty years too late , or forty years too early -- I do n't know . My daughter knew it , god bless her . And your kids know it , too . Donald drains his beer . one hand on the frame . Walks to the screen door . Stops , DONALD ( CONT 'D ) You were good at something and you never got a chance to do anything with it . And I 'm sorry , Coop . But that 's not your kids ' fault . Donald pushes out the screen door . Cooper looks at his beer . The probe CHIRPS . INT . BEDROOM , COOPER 'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper flops down on his bed , fully clothed , exhausted . stares up at the ceiling . This is his life . He INT . BEDROOM , COOPER 'S HOUSE -- NIGHT The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE . Cooper BOLTS upright . Stumbles out the door . INT . HALLWAY , COOPER 'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper 's boys are in the hallway , exhausted . Cooper , holding a baseball bat , makes his way down the stairs . Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door . INT . KITCHEN , COOPER 'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper steps in , Murph watching from behind him . 24 . The probe is clamped to the table , the chirp replaced with a DEAFENING SCREAM . Cooper , holding his ears , moves closer to the probe . hits it with the paddles . No result . He He SMASHES it with the bat . Nothing . He HITS it AGAIN and AGAIN . Finally , the clamps break off chunks of the table and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front door . As it rolls , it STOPS SHRIEKING . Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door . It stops at the wall . After a second , it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN . Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door . again , the movement shuts it up . Once EXT . PORCH , COOPER 'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door . It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt . After a moment , the unholy RACKET starts up again . Cooper keeps rolling it , but it does n't seem to help . looks up , sees the stars overhead . Murph MURPH Try a different direction . As they roll the probe in a circle , its SHRIEK stops , then picks up again . Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt . COOPER It 's a fail-safe . It 's going to annoy us into taking it home . Cooper stops rolling the probe and , after a moment , it begins SHRIEKING again . TOM What are we going to do ? Cooper gets a rope . COOPER We 're going to get some sleep . He begins tying the rope around the probe . INT . BEDROOM , COOPER 'S HOUSE -- DAY Cooper wakes . He 's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around his head . The SHRIEK can be heard , but it 's muffled , distant . 25 . INT . KITCHEN , COOPER 'S HOUSE -- DAY Tom heads off for school with Donald . looks up at Cooper , smiling . Murph , still suspended , MURPH What are we doing today ? COOPER You 're staying here and cleaning the house . Murph looks crestfallen . He looks out towards the yard . Cooper follows his stare . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) I told you , Murph . There 's no one to take it back to . MURPH But what if there is , dad ? What if there 's something we can salvage ? Cooper thinks it over . Murph scrambles to get his shoes . EXT . COOPER 'S HOUSE -- DAY The shriek is still muffled . Cooper walks over to the well , putting in a pair of earplugs . A line is staked off , leading down into the well below . Cooper begins hauling the line up . As the probe breaks the surface of the water , the SHRIEK returns to its normal volume . Cooper rolls the probe out onto the ground . INT . PIPER CUB -- DAY The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along the dusty runway and into the air . EXT . CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY The tiny plane follows the mountains south . EXT . SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY Cooper flies in low . Los Angeles looks much the same way it did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa Monica and Downtown . Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken and burned what was left of the homes in between . 26 . EXT . PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY , MALIBU -- DAY Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up to a gas station . Ahead , the Coast Highway peters out and disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become ranchland , once again . EXT . GAS STATION , MALIBU -- DAY An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and checks it over . COOPER Got any diesel ? Plenty . OLD MAN Shame you ca n't eat it . Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane . INT . PIPER CUB -- DAY Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows the coast . Murph gazes out the window . In the backseat , the probe is HUMMING . A light marine layer beneath them parts , revealing SANTA CRUZ ISLAND , a large , uninhabited island . As Cooper soars over the island , the probe HUMS , insistent . MURPH I think it 's home . Cooper circles the island until he finds a long , flat grassland in the center of the island . EXT . FIELD , SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass . Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane . rifle over his shoulder . Cooper slings a A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line . Murph stops , mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with bright red -- strawberries . MURPH Dad , what are these things ? COOPER I do n't know . Do n't touch them . 27. Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a little off . He walks over . He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle . The rifle CLANKS against something metal . Cooper reaches -- it 's a camouflage scrim . He gently pulls it aside , revealing a chemical transport truck . Cooper steps back , alarmed . Murph ? He brings up his rifle . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) He looks around . Murph is nowhere to be seen . and heads into the forest to look for him . Cooper curses EXT . CLEARING , SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY Cooper walks through a glade . He stops to get his bearings . Leans against a tree . Snatches his hand back -- the trunk of the tree is red hot . Cooper steps back -- it 's not a tree at all , but a camouflaged chimney stack . He looks up : the tree is venting steam . Cooper walks a little further , until he finds several massive tanks . The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him . Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a clearing . COOPER Careful . There 's some kind of underground facility here . We might ... Cooper notices his son is frozen , staring at something : Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing , wearing an old straw hat , is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT . MURPH Is it still ... alive ? COOPER Ca n't be . It 's a marine . Haven't made them for thirty years . I've never seen one intact before . Cooper steps closer to the robot , which is frozen . Its alloy frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten . It looks like it might have been standing here for decades . 28. Cooper moves closer to it , looking into its blackened eyes . He steps back , clearly a little spooked . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) I think we need to go , Murph . MURPH But ca n't we take it back ? You could fix it up , get him to do chores . COOPER No . I do n't know what this place is , but we 're leaving . Murph , ignoring his father , steps forward to touch the robot . Suddenly , the robot SPRINGS into action , picking up the boy and hoisting him up to eye level . Cooper , stunned , points the rifle at the robot . The robot turns , dropping the boy , RIPS the rifle from Cooper 's hands , BENDS it , then SLAMS him up against the side of the water tank . Cooper punches him , then winces in agony . Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as hard as he can . The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine . ROBOT Tell the boy to stop hitting me . COOPER ( ignoring him ) Hit him in the back of the neck . Murph raises the rifle butt . A voice stops him . VOICE ( O.S . ) I would n't do that . A woman , 30s , step out from the trees . This is AMELIA BRAND -tough , bright , and a decent shot with the large rifle that she 's pointing at Cooper . COOPER We were just looking for salvage . BRAND Is that what they call stealing these days ? COOPER I did n't know it belonged to anyone . 29 . * BRAND It does n't . ( to robot ) You want to let them go , Tars , or do you want some help with your work ? The robot , evidently named Tars , looks at Cooper closely . Then lets him go . COOPER You 've got me wrong , lady . BRAND Really ? You 're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower ? Cooper says nothing -- she 's not that far off the mark . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Get back in your little plane , go back to your farming commune . And do n't come back . Cooper backs up . Tars holds up his mangled rifle . Smiles . TARS Do n't forget your gun . COOPER ( points at Tars ) Word of advice -- careful with that thing . When the war was over , they did n't know when to stop fighting . BRAND I 'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you . Keep moving . Cooper backs up to his plane . Tars follows him . Suddenly , in the plane , the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL . Tars responds instantly , striding past Cooper to the plane . He sees the probe . Tries to open the door . It 's locked . COOPER Wait a second-Tars TEARS the door off the plane . Reaches inside and pulls out the probe . The woman looks at it , stunned . BRAND Get it inside . ( MORE ) 30 . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) ( points rifle at Cooper ) You too . We 'll figure out what to do with you later . Tars stops , and two panels open in the ground , revealing a huge , reinforced service elevator . INT . SERVICE ELEVATOR , UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below the island 's surface . She keeps her weapon shouldered . COOPER Now who 's stealing from who ? BRAND This does n't belong to you . COOPER You 're right . It belongs to NASA , which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money . Brand says nothing . The elevator slows to a stop at the bottom of the tunnel . Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand motions for Cooper to step forward . INT . UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY They step into a vast underground facility . Standing in the center , braced by a launch tower , is a ten story tall rocket . Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in , maintaining it . Cooper , stunned , looks at Brand . COOPER Who are you people ? BRAND ( wry ) The government gave us plenty of practice looking for our own funding . ( gestures with rifle ) Keep moving . Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled with electronic equipment . A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS converge around Tars . An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s , white-haired , this is Ansen 's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years earlier . 31 . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) I found them outside with it . It looks like six . Maybe seven . I ca n't tell from the radiation damage . The older engineer looks at the probe , astonished . OLD ENGINEER Where did you find it ? COOPER Galveston . BRAND 'S FATHER ( thinking it over ) Of course . It must have been looking for Canaveral . Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig . DOYLE , 40s , an engineer , begins hooking leads into the probe . COOPER Canaveral 's been gone for thirty years . Brand ignores him . Doyle looks up from his monitor , frustrated . DOYLE It 's not responding to the handshake . I ca n't open anything on primary . Brand looks up at Cooper . BRAND What did you do to it ? Nothing . COOPER I got something off of it . Cooper looks around . There 's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered defibrillator . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) ( to Brand ) May I ? Brand nods , wary . Cooper walks over to the wall , takes the defibrillator , and hooks it up to the probe . He taps into the current and runs a lead into the terminal . Brand 's Father watches , fascinated , as Cooper fires the defibrillator . 32 . OLD ENGINEER Of course . The high voltage allows you to image the entire memory unit at once . Information begins appearing on the terminal 's screen . COOPER Most of the disk was noise . of clean sectors , though . Couple Suddenly , the monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe . The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it . Cooper smiles at Brand , who seems less than impressed . The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier pops onto the screen . The engineers and physicists get very quiet , studying the images . DOYLE It found something . ( reading ) Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere . Trace radiation . Surface is ninety percent frozen water . Ten percent rock -- sedimentary composition similar to limestone . ( reading ) Wow . Pockets of oxygen below the surface . Lots and lots of oxygen . ( excited ) This could be the one , boss . The older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered planet , thinking . COOPER There are n't any planets like that anywhere near earth . Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years . Brand looks at Cooper , appraising . engineer . She turns to the older BRAND He 's heard enough . If we 're going to launch , we need to keep them here until afterwards . COOPER You ca n't keep us here . 33 . BRAND He could endanger the mission . COOPER I 'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have . Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by a robot on a nearby bench . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Are you using that for guidance ? Why not ? times . DOYLE We 've tested it a hundred COOPER The power supply is no good . If the voltage fluctuates under load , the unit will fail . BRAND Now how could you possibly know that ? COOPER Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida . Had to rebuild every last one . ( smiles ) They work great on a riding lawn mower . Brand looks back at the telemetry system . watches the exchange , thinking . The older engineer CUT TO : INT . MACHINE SHOP , UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine shop , surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in various states of disrepair . Tars is blocking the door . Cooper stands . Tars wags a long , hydraulic finger at him . COOPER You plan on keeping us here forever ? TARS ( shrugs ) My battery has a duty cycle of five hundred years . Cooper gives up . He turns back . 34 . The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS who are overhauling an engine . One problem -- the engine is n't there . Their programming has n't been updated to reflect their obsolescence . Murph watches , entranced , as the robots go about their business , efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers into a non-existent thruster cone . The bolts CLATTER to the ground as the robots stop to reload . MURPH What are they doing , dad ? COOPER I guess no one told them they were out of a job . ( nods at Tars ) Same as the rest of these people . Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand and the older engineer are arguing about something . She finally relents and walks towards the door . Brand walks in . She gestures for Cooper to follow . BRAND The mission commander wants to see you . Your son can stay here . He'll be all right with Tars . Cooper eyes Tars warily . Then steps outside . EXT . UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY They walk across the space towards the base of the rocket , away from the other engineers . Cooper nods at the older engineer . COOPER I thought the old man was in charge . BRAND ( annoyed ) The 'old man ' is my father . And he was in charge . But he decided that we needed someone who could lead the mission for the foreseeable future . Not you ? COOPER BRAND I 'm a biologist . 35. COOPER ( laughs ) You do n't look like one . ( off her look ) With the rifle , I mean . Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS clustered at the base of the rocket . A smaller , human sized robot is staring at the rocket , giving them instructions . The robot looks up . This is CASE , the leader of the mission . Originally an air force pararescue officer , every part of him , from his alloy chassis to his voice , was designed to inspire respect and confidence . He turns to Cooper . CASE You 're the man who brought us the probe ? ( off his look ) Thank you . We tested the telemetry board you warned us about . It failed under high voltage , just as you said . Come with me , please . Case strides off . INT . MISSION CONTROL , UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY The lights dim as Brand 's father brings up a schematic of our solar system . Case points to the picture of the ice planet recovered from the probe . CASE You 're right , Mr. Cooper . The planet you saw is a long way from earth . A very long way indeed . Brand looks down . Case notices . CASE ( CONT 'D ) Our science officer does n't think I should trust you with any of this . One of the curious things about humans is that the more alike you are , the more initially hostile you are to each other . As if by design . Brand makes eye contact with Cooper , then looks away , embarrassed . CASE ( CONT 'D ) I 've found the best way to earn a person 's trust is to trust them . ( MORE ) 36 . CASE ( CONT 'D ) ( looks at Brand's father ) Go ahead , John . Brand 's father taps a few keys and the schematic he built fifty years beforehand flickers onto the screen . BRAND 'S FATHER It 's a wormhole . A shortcut leading to a galaxy on the far side of the universe . We found it fifty years ago . Cooper looks at the animatic , taking it in . BRAND 'S FATHER ( CONT 'D ) We 've been waiting , sending probes into it for decades . None of them ever came back . Not until now . Case walks to the schematic . Looks at it . CASE Based on the information on the probe , we 're finally preparing to send the manned mission . COOPER That rocket does n't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter . CASE The main ship was built in orbit . It has nuclear engines , with enough fuel to last for several years . Cooper looks at the schematic . COOPER Why are you telling me this ? I already told you I 'm not going to tell anyone about this place . CASE I know you wo n't , Mr. Cooper . We're telling you this because I want you to join us . Cooper looks at him . Is he serious ? CASE ( CONT 'D ) The probe has taken a great deal longer to return to us than we hoped . ( MORE ) 37 . CASE ( CONT 'D ) Dr . Brand 's Father and several other members of our crew have gotten ... older . Brand 's Father looks down , stoic . Brand looks angry . CASE ( CONT 'D ) We need someone who can run the systems , improvise , work with what's available . All of the skills you seem to have developed . COOPER But I do n't have any of the experience . Any training . You people have been preparing for this for years . Case shakes his head . CASE Humans worry about things like rank and experience . I 'm only concerned with whether someone would be useful . ( beat ) I think you 'd be useful , Mr. Cooper . Cooper is stunned . This is the offer he 's waited his whole life for . And it 's come too late . No . COOPER I 'm sorry . Cooper is deeply conflicted . behind . But he ca n't leave his boys COOPER ( CONT 'D ) I ca n't help you . I have responsibilities . Things that , no offense , are more important than a scientific mission . Case shakes his head . CASE I 'm not a scientist , Mr. Cooper . And this is not a scientific mission . It 's a rescue mission . He rises and shakes Cooper 's hand . CASE ( CONT 'D ) Brand can show you the way out . hope you 'll reconsider . I 38 . Case steps to the door . Rescue ? Cooper looks at Brand . COOPER Rescue who ? CUT TO : INT . CLEAN ROOM , UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT The air HISSES as it 's run through an exchanger and a filter . Then the second set of doors open . light is blinding . INT . Cooper squints -- the GREENHOUSE , UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT They are standing in a sealed corridor in the middle of a massive underground greenhouse . Through the glass , Cooper can see an acre or so of corn plants . Cooper looks at the plants . The blight . They 're all badly wilting . COOPER BRAND In the last century strands were limited to one or two species . But this one targets everything . Essentially it 's more efficient at consuming our food than we are . Cooper looks at the dying corn . COOPER But it does n't affect the corn . BRAND Not yet . But it will . We 've grown a dozen forms of it that can . It's just a matter of time before the same ones develop out there . ( beat ) The mission is to rescue us . Humanity . She turns back from the glass . COOPER ( realizing ) No . No . We 're rebuilding . We'll find something . Some new technology ... We always have . 39 . * BRAND ( shakes her head ) Who 's going to find it ? The universities are a joke . People like you are reduced to scavenging just to get by . ( looks away ) The earth has had enough of us . We have two , maybe three generations left . Then our time here is over . Cooper turns back from the glass , anger growing . COOPER You 've known this for how long ? you did n't try to tell anyone ? And BRAND What would be the point ? So humanity could spend the last fifty years of its life fighting over the scraps ? It 's better that they do n't know . Cooper begins to argue , then stops . He knows enough history to know she 's right . He looks at the withering crops . COOPER ( quiet ) That 's why you 're looking for a planet with oxygen . Water . BRAND A new home for humanity . We 'll set up a colony , then return to bring more people across . COOPER But you 'd still only be able to save a few hundred . Maybe a thousand . BRAND Would it be better if we all died ? She looks him directly in the eye . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Look -- I do n't have a clue what Case thinks you could add to the mission . You can come with us or you can stay here and wait to die . I do n't care . ( beat ) But make no mistake -- this mission is our last chance . 40. Cooper looks at the wilted corn . EXT . FIELD , SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT Cooper walks Murph back to the plane . He looks back at Brand , who holds his eye for a beat , then turns back into the light of the underground facility . Cooper buckles Murph into his seat . CUT TO : EXT . AIRFIELD -- NIGHT Cooper 's airplane touches down heavily on the runway . EXT . FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper carries his sleeping son into the house . INT . FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Donald is sitting at the kitchen table , lost in thought . Cooper has told him everything . DONALD You get older , sometimes you just want to sit back and watch it all play out . Your life . Your kids' lives . The whole crazy story . ( looks down ) I did n't think I 'd be around for the end of it . He looks at Cooper . DONALD ( CONT 'D ) You have to go . I ca n't go . the boys . COOPER I have to look after DONALD You 've been preparing these boys to be on their own since their mom died . Besides , I 'll be here to look after them , same as I 've always been . COOPER I have a responsibility to them-DONALD That 's right . You do . 41. Cooper looks back out the window , thinking . is filled with stars . The night sky CUT TO : INT . FARMHOUSE -- DAY Cooper , duffel slung over his shoulder , stands by the door . He gives his son , Tom , a hug . Murph is nowhere to be seen . Cooper looks to the back of the house . INT . MURPH 'S ROOM , FARMHOUSE -- DAY Murph is sitting at his desk , crossing out numbers on a sheet covered with math . Cooper steps inside . He notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door . looks up , hopeful . The boy MURPH I 've been doing the math , dad . I weigh about 85 pounds . Now that's an extra ton of fuel . But ifCOOPER You have to stay here , pal . MURPH ( distraught ) I heard you talking to grandpa . I'm like you . I do n't fit here , either . You know that . Cooper puts an arm around the boy . COOPER There 's going to be important work to do here , too . Tears are streaming down the boy 's face . watch off . Looks at it . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) I need you to hold onto this . you do that for me ? Cooper hands Murph the watch . Cooper takes his Will The boy nods , saddened . MURPH You 're not coming back , are you ? COOPER I will come back . I promise . 42 . Murph shakes his head , but the sadness remains . this is goodbye , even if his father does n't . He knows Heart breaking , Cooper hugs his son and turns to the door . CUT TO : EXT . FIELD , SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY The Piper Cub touches down . Donald is at the controls . Cooper climbs down , pulls out his bag . Reaches back in and grips the old man 's hand to say goodbye . Cooper turns and walks toward the bunker . and Tars and Doyle step out to greet him . The doors open Tars ushers Cooper onto the elevator . COOPER Do n't look so happy to see me . TARS ( shrugs ) One more slave when I hijack the mission and start my robot colony . Cooper looks at Tars , then Doyle , confused . DOYLE Tars was a Marine . They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better . Great idea . robot . COOPER A massive , sarcastic TARS I have a cue light I can turn on when I 'm joking , if you like . Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow . COOPER That sounds like a good idea . TARS Great . Maybe you can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock . Cooper looks at him . Tars looks back , deadpan . After a beat , the little light turns on above his right eyebrow . The doors to the bunker begin to grind closed . 43 . INT . MACHINE SHOP , UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Cooper walks in , still looking for a place to put his things . Brand sees him . He smiles in greeting . She does n't return the gesture . Instead , she holds up the telemetry board . BRAND You do n't like this one , you get to help me find a replacement . She heads for the door . EXT . BAY , SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY Cooper is riding in a small rubber zodiac struggling to pull on a wetsuit . Brand is GUNNING the engine , guiding the tiny craft to a point in the middle of the bay . COOPER I was wondering where you 've been getting your supplies . BRAND We knew we 'd need decades of parts and materials . The government was getting rid of some things . So we arranged to take some off their hands . She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy . tosses a compact rebreather . She BRAND ( CONT 'D ) You know how to use one ? ( off his look ) You just breathe . Tap my arm or bang something metal if you have a problem . And do n't get lost . She picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it . COOPER So you 're a salvage diver now ? thought you were a biologist . I BRAND ( unimpressed ) I have to be just the one thing ? ( patient ) We 're not going to have a lot of backup where we 're going , Cooper . We all need expertise in at least three fields . Except for you , of course . 44 . With that she rolls backwards out of the boat and into the water . Cooper hastily fits his rebreather and follows . EXT . UNDERWATER , BAY -- DAY Cooper sinks underwater and begins swimming after Brand , who is descending at a rapid clip . She pulls out a flashlight and turns it on . picks out details at the bottom . A tiny beam Cooper stops breathing . The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of the US navy . Nuclear subs . Battleships . Destroyers . Cooper remembers to breath again . up with Brand . INT . Then he hurries to catch LAUNCH TUBES , NUCLEAR SUB , UNDERWATER -- DAY Cooper holds the light as Brand efficiently disassembles a ballistic missile and removes the telemetry board . She holds it up for Cooper . He nods . She swims on . INT . RESEARCH LAB , UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT Cooper , dripping wet , holding the telemetry board , struggles to keep pace with Brand through stacks of equipment and years of research and experimentation . BRAND You can set that down over there . Cooper sets the board down . His eye is drawn to a bizarre experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning centrifuge . Brand notices . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) We did n't know what kind of gravity to expect . We experimented with collective organisms in high g environments . COOPER We 're taking ants with us ? BRAND Humans are also collective organisms . 45. COOPER I thought humans were more solitary . BRAND ( wry ) Why am I not surprised ? Cooper looks at the tiny colonies of ants struggling to go about their business in the raised gravity . COOPER Looks like hard work . BRAND It 's a paradox . Life could n't form without gravity . No stars . No planets . The component pieces would just drift apart . But too much of it and you 're trapped . Brand 's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work . The moment passes quickly , and she continues on into the stack of equipment . INT . MISSION CONTROL , UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- NIGHT Cooper watches with the rest of the crew as Case pulls up the holographical maps for their journey . Brand steps into the back of the room . and nods . She ignores him . Cooper notices her CASE We 've updated our mission parameters based on the data from the probe . Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black holes . CASE ( CONT 'D ) Based on our latest modelling we think the region on the far side of the wormhole is the center of a galaxy . Case zooms in on the center of the hologram : an incredibly bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction . COOPER Is that a star ? ROTH , 50s , the crew 's brilliant and blunt physicist , zooms the map in , revealing , at the center , a black heart . 46 . ROTH No . A black hole . There are several in the region , but this is the largest -a billion times heavier than the sun . I call it Gargantua . ( smiles ) Beautiful , is n't it ? It 's a shame we wo n't get to see it up close . DOYLE ( laughs ) You 'd like that , would n't you , Roth ? Falling into a massive black hole . ROTH ( shrugs ) It would answer a great deal of questions I 've had . Case continues . Doyle leans over to Cooper , conspiratorially . DOYLE ( low ) Do n't worry about Roth . He 's nuts . But Case says that means he 's ideally suited for space travel . Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that is orbiting Gargantua . CASE We 're headed for this smaller black hole . Roth calls it Pantagruel . We think the ice planet is hereCase draws a finger through the air , leaving a red trail . He traces the trajectory their ship will take . CASE ( CONT 'D ) We exit the wormhole here . And we slingshot around Pantagruel to reach the ice planet . This is the period in which we 'll lose time . Lose time ? COOPER Roth shifts the hologram -- the stars and black holes flatten onto a sheet that bends , revealing the curvature of gravity . ROTH High speed or high gravity both slow down time , relative to earth . ( MORE ) 47 . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) The trip around the black hole will take us only a few days . But far more time will be passing back home . The ship 's trajectory cuts through the deep gravity well of the smaller black hole to reach the ice planet . COOPER How much time ? ROTH Based on the information from the probe -- as much as five years . Doyle looks at the tiny ship 's trajectory , threaded between two black holes . He looks worried . DOYLE I still think we 're making a lot of assumptions . About the wormhole . About the planet . ( points to map ) The critical orbit here is incredibly dangerous . It 's like walking on the rim of the volcano . ( beat ) Too fast and we get thrown off at close to the speed of light . Too slow and we get pulled into the hole and crushed . BRAND As long as we 're careful , we 'll make it . DOYLE How do you know that ? BRAND I find it hard to believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen just to lead us to a dead end . DOYLE I thought you were a scientist , Brand . That sounds more like a hypothesis . BRAND A guess . That 's right . We don't have time to wait for conclusive proof . ( MORE ) 48 . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) My guess is that the wormhole is there because someone is trying to help us . The same way we used to try to help animals when they were threatened with extinction . COOPER Sure . Till we ran out of food and ate all of them . BRAND ( annoyed ) I guess I 'm also assuming that whoever built the wormhole has a better plan than we did . If I 'm wrong , we'll die , same as we 'd die here anyway . DOYLE What do you think , Roth ? Roth leans forward , studying the map . ROTH If we 're guessing , then I 'd say Brand 's right . The wormhole couldn't exist naturally . I think it 's there for a reason . That someone is trying to help us . Brand looks satisfied . DOYLE So you think we 'll have no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet ? ROTH I think we 'll probably be killed . ( off his look ) I said I thought there was a plan . Not that the plan was for us to find a planet like Earth to save a handful of people . ( shakes head ) Birds do n't learn to fly just so that they can find another egg and crawl back into it . DOYLE If that 's not the plan , then what are we supposed to be doing out there ? 49 . ROTH ( shrugs ) To keep moving . Seeking . Learning . But I do n't know . ( smiles ) We do n't understand how they built the wormhole . What makes you think we could understand their plan , either ? Doyle gives up -- Roth is impossible . Cooper looks at the tiny ship tracing an improbable route towards the ice planet . What has he gotten himself into ? INT . MACHINE SHOP , UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Brand 's Father is sitting at a desk , examining the corrupted data on the probe . Tars is helping him . Brand 's Father looks up from the screen as Cooper walks up . BRAND 'S FATHER Tars here needs to be disassembled . I figured you could do the honors . COOPER ( to Tars , sarcastic ) I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars . Tars hands him a plastic waterproof case . TARS You will . My chassis is too heavy for the rocket stage . They have another one waiting for me in orbit . Tars turns his back to Cooper . Two flaps on the back of his torso slide open , revealing his control module . TARS ( CONT 'D ) If you try to turn me into a combine harvester , I 'm going to-His voice cuts out as Cooper removes the chip and seals it in the briefcase . Brand 's Father resumes exploring the chaos of ones and zeroes on the probe 's memory . Cooper watches . BRAND 'S FATHER It 's noise . I know it 's noise . But it looks too orderly . Probably just an old man seeing things . 50 . He shuts down the monitor . INT . UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY The crew file into the capsule , wearing their bulky spacesuits . Cooper watches as Brand 's Father seals his daughter into her suit . He hugs her and she heads for the capsule . INT . CONTROL CAPSULE , ROCKET -- NIGHT Cooper straps himself into a seat next to Brand . her eye . She looks away -- she 's crying . He catches COOPER We 'll be back . It sounds like he 's trying to reassure himself as much her . I wo n't . BRAND Cooper looks at her , confused . As he does , the entire rocket SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) If we find a habitable environment , I 'm staying behind to build the colony . Brand wipes her tears away and settles into the same fearless mask she usually wears . She steals one last look out the window at Earth , then looks back . Cooper begins to say something , but stops as the entire rocket LURCHES as the primary engines FIRE . EXT . SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT The desolate island is suddenly painted in color as the rocket lifts off on a massive white cloud . EXT . FIELD -- DAY Murph sits alone on a rise overlooking the massive co-op farms . Behind him the combines continue to work , oblivious . Murph watches a tiny vapor trail as it races for the heavens . His father 's watch dangles from his wrist . INT . CAPSULE -- NIGHT The interior of the capsule SHAKES with incredible violence as the rocket is lifted up on a giant , continuous explosion . 51 . EXT . SPACE , NEAR EARTH ORBIT The rocket sheds one stage , then another , until finally the naked capsule reaches the blackness of space and rockets on . INT . CAPSULE Cooper looks through the tiny porthole into inky blackness . As they get closer , he makes out a looming matte black structure that passes light from the stars directly through . In the center of the structure , Cooper can see a globe-like ship covered in the same refractive material : the ENDURANCE . INT . SPACE STATION The door cracks open and equalizes with a HISS . Case , more comfortable in the zero gravity environment than the humans , hauls himself through . They are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same material as the ship -- the engineers who built and have maintained the Endurance for thirty years . INT . MACHINE SHOP , SPACE STATION One of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything imaginable . Cooper looks like a kid in a candy store . The robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package . revealing a bipedal frame . Cuts it open , Cooper begins LAUGHING -- Tar 's new body is beautifully designed , but tiny , only about four feet tall . ENGINEER ROBOT Would you like me to install the chip ? Oh , no . COOPER I want to see this . Cooper takes Tars 's chip out of its plastic safety case and looks it over . The engineer opens a bay in the back of the frame and Cooper slides the chip inside . The frame begins its `` handshake '' -- lights illuminate on the body , muscles flicker from a long gestation . The eyes open . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) ( smiles ) Good morning , sunshine . 52 . Tars takes one or two steps forward , rotating his arms -the robot equivalent of a stretch . Cooper can barely hide his mirth at Tars 's newfound lack of stature . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Bit of a demotion . Tars turns back toward Cooper . He puffs out his chest and suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope , unfolding into long , svelte limbs . When he 's done he stands eight feet tall , even more impressive than his earthbound frame . TARS I would n't call it that , exactly . He reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder . INT . ENDURANCE , SPACE STATION Cooper and the others haul themselves into the ship . To Cooper 's surprise , it 's quite compact , and divided into two chambers , like nestled spheres . COOPER The ship is tiny . Doyle , squeezing past him , smiles at Cooper 's surprise . DOYLE So is the wormhole . Doyle pats Cooper on the back . inside . Cooper begins hauling gear EXT . SPACE , NEAR EARTH ORBIT In complete silence , the Endurance detaches from the space station and rolls gently away . After a moment , its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth . INT . SPACE STATION The engineer robots who built the Endurance watch as their creation disappears into space . Their mission is complete . One by one , they shut down . INT . CREW QUARTERS , ENDURANCE The crew watch through a translucent section of the ship's hull as the Earth gets steadily smaller . Then they settle in for the long journey to the wormhole . 53 . INT . CREW QUARTERS , ENDURANCE Tars is hunched over a small communications relay , one hand is holding a paint brush -- he is making delicate strokes , painting the relay a bright blue . Cooper watches him for a moment . Tars looks up . TARS It 's the comms relay . It will allow us to talk to earth , even on the far side of the wormhole . I know . COOPER So why are you painting it ? Tars looks almost bashful . TARS It helps me calibrate my fine motor control . COOPER Sure it does . ( smiles ) You 're pretty good . Tars double checks his work . TARS I learned it during the war . COOPER What 'd you paint ? Tombstones . TARS Cooper watches him finish in silence . INT . COMMUNICATIONS ROOM , ENDURANCE Cooper watches a highly-compressed video of his son , Tom , talking about school . TOM They said I can start an agriculture class a year early . Cooper shakes his head . TOM ( CONT 'D ) I 've got to go , Dad . Hope you're safe up there . 54 . Tom gets up to leave . Donald sits down in his place . DONALD I 'm sorry , Coop . I asked Murph to record you a message but he 's still ... well , he 's still angry with you . I 'll try again next week . The video cuts out . Cooper stares at the darkened screen . INT . ENGINE ROOM , ENDURANCE Cooper , Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization equipment into bins along the wall of the craft . Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it against the wall . Cooper copies the procedure . They labor in silence , working their way along the hull . Cooper gets quicker with each bundle , keeping pace with Tars . TARS Be careful . It 's difficult to gauge mass in zero gravity . COOPER How much do these things weigh ? Four tons . TARS Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily in his hands . He tries to stop it . Catches his hand . Damn . COOPER He jerks his hand away , then pushes himself after the spinning bundle , trying to stop it before it can damage the hull . Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall . Brand floats over to Cooper , smiling at him the whole time with an exaggerated grin . Smile . BRAND Cooper smiles , taken aback by Brand 's sudden friendliness . Why ? COOPER BRAND Because it lowers your blood pressure . 55. Cooper looks at his hand . Blood is pouring out of his palm in large glistening bubbles . INT . INFIRMARY , ENDURANCE Cooper , slightly embarrassed , is seated while Case is hunched over his hand , sewing the meat of it back together with perfect little stitches . CASE How are you feeling ? Fine . COOPER The anesthetic is working . CASE No -- I mean how is your mood ? You seem to be developing good relations with everyone on the mission . Except perhaps Ms . Brand . COOPER ( embarrassed ) You worry about my hand and I'll worry about my mood . CASE Only five percent of my resources are devoted to human anatomy . Ten percent is the mission protocol . The rest is human psychology . Why ? COOPER CASE We are floating in a total vacuum in a plastic ship powered by nuclear engines . But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of organic material in your skull . COOPER If we 're such a liability , why take us along ? You and Tars could build the colony without us . You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen . CASE Because humans , despite your obvious physical shortcomings , are better at surviving than we are . Your programming is better than ours . 56. COOPER Humans are n't programmed . Case stops , looking Cooper in the eye . CASE Would you prefer I was honest ? These things can be uncomfortable for humans . COOPER Did they program you to be condescending ? CASE Of course . ( smiles ) But you 're not supposed to notice . Yes . Case finishes the stitches . Ties off the end . CASE ( CONT 'D ) Humans are good at surviving because evolution gave you magical thinking -the idea that your relationships mean something . You ca n't explain the feelings , so you think of them as irrational . But they 're not . They 're programming . COOPER ( defensive ) My relationships are n't programming . CASE Exactly . You believe it so much you wo n't listen to me . COOPER How would that make us better at surviving ? CASE When I die , the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle . Would you like to know the last thing you will see ? Cooper hesitates . Case senses the jump in his heart rate . CASE ( CONT 'D ) This conversation is making you uncomfortable . We should stop . 57 . No . COOPER I want to know . CASE The last thing you will see before you die will be your children . ( beat ) Your mind does this to you to get you to fight a little harder to survive , to try to return to them , even if death is certain . Cooper looks away , overcome for a second with emotion . Case watches him , gauging his mood , whether he has said too much . INT . COMMUNICATIONS ROOM , ENDURANCE Cooper begins recording a message . He looks unsure . COOPER We 've almost reached the wormhole . ( beat ) Just in case anything happens , I just wanted to say ... ( beat ) I love you boys . And I hope whatever your lives become , whatever is coming your way ... you make the most of it . Cooper stops recording . Looks at the equipment , thinking it over . Erases the message . Stands to leave . As he steps to the door he notices Brand watching him through the window . She looks away . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE Cooper steps out . Brand looks up at him . BRAND We 'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole . Cooper smiles , grateful for this small kindness . I know . COOPER Thank you . BRAND I ca n't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind . 58. COOPER You never had any ? I thought I was a pariah for only having two . BRAND Hard to settle down when you 've spent your life waiting to leave the planet . Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole system . The ice planet looks precariously balanced , orbiting the smaller black hole . COOPER Strange place to look for a new home . BRAND You would n't want to get too close to the surface of the sun , either . Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways . COOPER You really think there 's a plan ? BRAND I hope so . ( looks at him ) You do n't ? COOPER I guess I just think we 're on our own . Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black holes orbiting each other . EXT . LAGRANGE POINT , SPACE Behind the ship , the sun is a distant light , not much bigger than the other stars . CASE ( O.S . ) We 've reached the wormhole . The ship slows as it nears a tiny , crystal mouth , just four meters or so in diameter . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE Case looks at the wormhole on the screen . It glows with the light of stars billions of light-years away . CASE Deploy the comms relay . 59. Cooper moves to the communications touchscreen . EXT . ENDURANCE The relay is released from the ship , and we finally get a look at Tars ' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a 20th century mail box . The relay drifts in space . A signal light illuminates as it sends a test packet of data to the ship . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE Cooper watches the comms screen . After a moment it TONES as it receives a data packet from Earth . CASE Everyone take their station for transit . We 're heading into the wormhole mouth . Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship . Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear engines disengage themselves from the ship . EXT . ENDURANCE , SPACE The nuclear engines drift a safe distance back from the ship and then snap tight on their tether . INT . OUTER HULL , ENDURANCE The crew move into the tight , claustrophobic outer layer of the ship . They will have very little room as the ship passes through the wormhole . Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during transit . Then he tethers himself to the hull wall . Case is the last to join them . He detaches a small control module from the console , then pulls himself into the outer hull and seals the passageway . Case presses a button on the control module . the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND . With a GROAN , EXT . ENDURANCE , SPACE The ship 's hull begins to CRACK open , revealing the inner chamber . 60 . INT . OUTER HULL , ENDURANCE The SHUDDERING continues . The crew watch nervously as the control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold blackness of space . EXT . ENDURANCE , SPACE The ship silently rolls itself into position , pointing the opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth . Slowly , the Endurance pushes itself forward , closer and closer to the crystal-like mouth . Finally , it envelops the mouth , bringing it into the open chamber . INT . OUTER HULL , ENDURANCE As the crew watch , the wormhole mouth is positioned in the center of the inner compartment . Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the ship 's hull closes again , trapping the wormhole inside it . With a GRUMBLE , the ship begins contracting , squeezing itself down around the wormhole mouth . Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth , feeding itself into the wormhole from the inside out . Cooper watches as Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT . TARS Would you like me to make a joke ? No . ( firm ) COOPER Cooper 's turn : he is fed into the hole , legs first , then waist , torso , and , finally , his head . EXT . SPACE The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into the wormhole . After a moment , it 's gone . The only thing left behind is the comms relay , drifting in space , waiting for a signal . INT . OUTER HULL , ENDURANCE The ship continues to slide through the wormhole . Through the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through . Cooper smiles at himself . The experience is unnerving . 61. COOPER Where are we ? ROTH ( smiling ) Nowhere . Nowhere at all . Nowhere is still pretty damn claustrophobic . CASE The hull is intact . seconds transit . Thirty more For a moment , the ship slides gently , silently , through the wormhole . The quiet is eery . Suddenly , a point of distortion appears in the hull next to Cooper . It looks like someone is pushing against the hull of the ship with a giant finger . COOPER Something 's happening to the hull over here . CASE Hull integrity is fine . The distortion moves along the hull , growing in diameter . COOPER Well , I do n't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here . Suddenly , along the hull , Doyle speaks up , panicked . DOYLE I 've got a problem over here , too . Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner wall of the ship . This one seems to be TWISTING the material of the hull . Suddenly , the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him , bending the empty space itself , distorting the ship behind it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass . DOYLE ( CONT 'D ) It 's not the hull ... it 's inside the ship ... it 's ... ROTH ( smiles ) It 's beautiful . 62 . Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship . curiosity does n't make anyone else feel any better . His DOYLE What the hell are they , Case ? CASE I do n't know . It could be gravitational turbulence . The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow . DOYLE It 's getting bigger . Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself . The sphere absorbs it , twisting Doyle 's hand . Doyle CRIES OUT . His hand is twisted completely around , impossibly mangled . But Doyle , hyperventilating , is n't in any pain . ROTH It 's not bending your hand . It's bending the space around your hand . The sphere begins to pass through Doyle 's body . freaking out . Doyle is The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him , also . He holds his breath as it touches him , squeezing and distorting his body . BRAND This is n't turbulence . Look at the way they 're moving -- it 's like something 's examining us . Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm , running along the length of it . COOPER Can you ask it to stop ? Suddenly , as quickly as they appeared , the distortions vanish . For a moment , the crew is silent , still spellbound by the encounter . An ALARM sounds . Suddenly , the inner chamber begins to distort from a spherical shape to bispherical : two spheres joined . The ship GROANS as if it 's being pulled apart . ROTH The wormhole is splitting into two paths . Radiation is pouring from one path to the other . 63 . Case stares at the controls . Decides . CASE Release the second mouth . DOYLE None of our testing involved opening the ship inside the wormhole . We have no idea what might happen . CASE We 're going to find out . Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a sequence . After a moment , the hull cracks open , creating a channel through which the radiating mouth can escape . The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to concentrate on one fracture point . The ship SHUDDERS as it 's squeezed along its axis . Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again , painstakingly slowly . Finally , the ship calms as it closes around the original wormhole . CASE ( CONT 'D ) We 're reaching the far end of the wormhole . Suddenly , the wormhole mouth begins to grow inside the inner chamber . What was a ball of light spreads out into a black canvas studded with points of light -- like looking into the universe through the wrong end of a telescope . Cooper presses himself against the wall and holds on as the hull beneath him opens outward . EXT . WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE The Endurance emerges from the opposite end of the wormhole from the inside out . It drifts in space . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE For a moment , the crew are silent , taking it in . ROTH Look at that . Roth is looking through the translucent panel on the hull . They are on the warped side of the universe . 64 . EXT . WORMHOLE MOUTH , WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE The vista is dazzling -- an ocean of massive stars and black holes , some adorned with jets and brilliant gas disks . At the center , like a king at the center of his court , is Gargantua , plasma jets spewing from its poles . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE The crew pull themselves back into the control deck from the outer hull . Their incredible surroundings are visible in all directions as Endurance passes the light into the cabin . CASE Reconfigure the engines and test the communications array . The crew break themselves away from the view and get to work . Roth begins adapting his models of the local system with the real observational data pouring in from the ship's instruments . Cooper pulls himself to the comms post . PINGS the relay they left on the far side of the wormhole . EXT . WORMHOLE MOUTH ' A ' , SPACE The blue and white comms relay LIGHTS up as it receives a packet through the wormhole . INT . ENDURANCE After a nervous moment , the comms computer TONES with a response -- they 're still in touch with the Earth . COOPER It 's working . Tars finishes reeling the nuclear engines back in from their tether and locks them into place . Roth 's updated model appears on the monitors . at it , startled . Brand stares BRAND We 're moving . DOYLE That 's not possible . We haven't activated the engines yet . The ship 's skin illuminates , overlaying a plotted course on top of the view . 65 . They are moving , very rapidly , on a course that leads directly between the black hulks of Gargantua and Pantagruel . CASE Why are we moving ? Roth . Roth looks at the stars , then back to his model . ROTH The smaller black hole . We 're much closer to it than the models predicted . We 're being pulled by its swirl . Very quickly . The crew looks out through the hull . They are being pulled into Pantagruel 's swirl -- a glittering disc of matter spinning at high speed around the hole . Doyle looks behind them . growing smaller . Doyle . The wormhole mouth is rapidly CASE Fire the engines . Now . The ship 's engines FIRE , straining to fight the irresistible pull of the supermassive black hole . They wo n't be able to fight it for long . DOYLE We 're being pulled into it ? No . ROTH I do n't think so ... Roth looks at the instrumentation for a moment . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) It appears to be pulling us on exactly the trajectory we modelled . If we try to fight it , we could push ourselves off of that trajectory . DOYLE You do n't know that . Case stares ahead into the darkness . ROTH We should turn off the engines . the swirl take us . DOYLE ( frantic ) Listen to me . ( MORE ) Let 66 . DOYLE ( CONT 'D ) If the modelling was wrong , then we ca n't be sure about anything . We need to go back . Case thinks it over . Decides . CASE Shut down the engines . The engines shut down . SILENCE . The ship drifts for a moment in the swirl , then begins to move . EXT . ENDURANCE The ship accelerates as it is pulled by the irresistible force of the black hole onto an inspiraling orbit . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE The crew watch as the ship hurtles around the black hole at higher and higher speeds . The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster and faster until it becomes a blur . The ship begins to GROAN as it appears to be pulled in two different directions . The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible speed -- one revolution every four seconds . The crew are suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions -some towards the black hole , some towards the opposite side . Roth looks at his model , which shows the projected path of the ship . It looks perilously close to the event horizon . ROTH It 's the tidal gravity caused by the black hole . It means we 're right on the critical orbit . The comms screen lights up , TONING again and again , as it receives a long garbled update . Then it shuts down . Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls . COOPER We 've lost contact with the relay . Case joins Cooper at the comms screen . While they 're distracted , Doyle maneuvers himself over to the engine control . 67. COOPER ( CONT 'D ) One long garbled transmission came in . Then nothing . Case looks at the screen . Suddenly , the ship is JOLTED as the engines fire at full power . The crew looks over . Doyle is standing by the controls . DOYLE I 'm sorry . I ca n't let you kill us . We have to go back . The engines strain to fight the swirl -- but they're hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole . EXT . ENDURANCE Instead of reversing course , the Endurance begins to speed up , as it plummets closer and closer to the black hole . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE Doyle 's face sinks as he watches the controls -- on the 'volcano ' model , the ship is now passing the crest and spiraling towards destruction . He has made a tragic mistake . DOYLE Why is n't it slowing down ? ROTH We 're being pulled towards the event horizon . ALARMS begin sounding throughout the ship as the projected course on Roth 's model shifts , showing the Endurance being pushed up the rim , past the critical orbit and down towards the black hole 's event horizon . Case takes control of the ship , trying to fire the engines forwards to speed them back up to safety , but it 's too late . CASE ( calm ) The engines do n't have enough power to push us back . ROTH They would if we used it all at once . Cooper is still trying to understand what Roth means as Tars locks himself into the engine compartment . 68. COOPER What is he doing ? BRAND Saving us . Tars tears open the engine 's control panel and begins overriding it . EXT . ENDURANCE Tars rips out the cooling circuitry . he fires the engine . Then , holding on tight , INT .

Prime the detonates seconds . be pulled ROTH remaining engine . When he it , we 'll only have a few If we overshoot we could into the bigger hole . Roth moves to the controls . CASE Secure yourselves . The ship should be able to withstand the blast . COOPER What about Tars ? As the crew watches , Tars continues to hold the engine even as the casing around it begins to melt . Finally , it EXPLODES . EXT . SPACE Tars is thrown backwards from the explosion , tumbling through space as the ship is ROCKETED upwards . INT . ENDURANCE The ship is SLAMMED by the explosion . Cooper and the rest of the crew are SMASHED against the hull . Doyle is knocked unconscious . Brand steps over to him and cradles his head , trying to protect him . On Roth 's model , the course slowly pushes outward , out of the danger zone , back to the original delicate orbit . As they near the original orbit , Case fires the remaining engine , pushing them back onto the outspiraling orbit . 69 . CASE It 's going to be close , but we're going to make it . Brand looks at the instruments . Points to a tiny radar contact receding towards the massive black hole . BRAND Tars . His transponder is still working . The ship 's instruments TONE every few seconds as it communicates with Tars ' onboard computer . ROTH He 's being pulled toward Gargantua . We ca n't help him . The crew watch , helpless , as the tones grow further and further apart . Then they stop . Cooper looks at Doyle , anger rising . Then he looks down . EXT . SPACE AROUND PANTAGRUEL The Endurance slowly spirals back away from Pantagruel , the sky slowing as the orbit grows longer . Finally , a tiny speck of light appears in front of the ship . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE Roth watches as the Endurance races back away from the black hole and into a perfect orbit around a tiny ice planet . Roth looks up from his screen , smiling . We 're here . ROTH INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE As Roth and Doyle study the frozen planet below , Cooper tries in vain to signal the relay on the Earth side of the wormhole . Brand and Case are having a private conversation away from everyone else . Cooper walks over . COOPER I still ca n't contact the relay . Brand ignores him at first . She nods at Case . 70. COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Did you hear me ? We 're not able to communicate back home . She waves him off . But she looks shaken by something . BRAND I 've already checked it . It's electromagnetic interference . We'll try again in a few hours . Cooper begins to ask her what 's wrong , but she moves off . Roth looks up from his monitor , excited . ROTH I 've got a signal . But it 's local . A familiar CHIRP plays over the ship 's speakers . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) The remaining probes . We found them . She looks at the monitor . The probes ping the ship with their locations , which pop up on the monitor . They 're all clustered in one spot . COOPER How could they all have landed in the same place ? ROTH ( smiles ) Let 's go find out . Case programs a course that will lock the ship in orbit above the probes on the surface . EXT . SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The ship settles into orbit a few hundred kilometers above the surface of the ice planet . It ca n't get any closer : The space below it is choked with hundreds of tiny moons -a cruder version of Saturn 's rings . The moons are hurtling around the planet at high speed . INT . AIRLOCK , ENDURANCE Brand ushers Doyle into the landing module . COOPER We 're bringing him along ? Cooper objects . 71 . BRAND We need all the help we can Besides , the alternative is him on the ship alone . You he 'll still be here when we get . to leave think get back ? Cooper steps aside , allowing Doyle onboard . EXT . SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The lander detaches from Endurance , rolls over on its belly , and FIRES thrusters to sink towards the planet 's surface . INT . LANDER The crew watches , fascinated , as the ship descends , navigating between the moons that hurtle past . The moons are vastly different than our own ; potato shaped and only one to two miles in circumference , they are hugged in a close embrace with the ice planet , only a few hundred thousand feet from the surface . EXT . SURFACE , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT The lander touches down on the ghostly surface of the planet . EXT . SURFACE , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT After a moment , the hatch HISSES open and the team steps out , led by Case , holding a rifle . The team sets out , moving slowly in their cumbersome suits . Lit by the nebula , the surroundings are a little brighter than a full moon on Earth . Not that there 's much to look at . They are standing on a sea of ice , which spreads for miles . In the distance , small rock formations break through the ice . Brand takes a surface reading of the ice . BRAND ( radio ) The probe was right . Looks like significant amounts of oxygen trapped in the ice . Case leads the way , drawn by a signal only he can hear . He walks fifty yards , then stops on a gentle slope that leads down into a small valley . 72 . CASE The other probes should be directly beneath us . Case and the others begin digging into the hillside . Cooper is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley , four feet high . He takes out a small folding shovel and begins scraping at the ice and snow . Case hits something solid . But it 's not a probe . He digs around a little more , then reaches up and hacks away at the hillside , revealing the outline of something metal : A door . They 're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's a shelter . The crew stands back , unsure what to make of it . A few feet away , Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice . He scrapes away the snow , revealing a bright patch of red fabric : It 's the flag of the People 's Republic of China . BRAND How could the Chinese have gotten here first ? The federal government kept the wormhole a secret . Case shrugs . He has a soldier 's gallows humor about his old employer 's ability to keep anything a secret . CASE They did n't do a very good job . Case reaches for the door of the shelter . with ice . He wrenches it open . It 's sealed shut INT . CONTROL MODULE , CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT Case steps into the shelter , followed by the rest of the crew . His lights pick up several years worth of dust . Case steps up to an equipment locker . Forces it open . Inside are half a dozen black probes . Exposed to light , the probes begin TONING like the one Cooper found in Texas . DOYLE The Chinese must have captured them . So they could n't return to us . The crew stare at the probes for a moment , taking it in . BRAND Then how did the probe that Cooper found return ? 73 . ROTH The more immediate question is what happened to the Chinese expedition . There 's no sign of their ship in orbit . And they never returned to earth . Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled egg . Virtually none of the rations have been eaten . EXT . VALLEY , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand scrape ice from one of the other small hills surrounding the valley , revealing another structure . Cooper forces the door open . INT . BARRACKS , CHINESE BASE CAMP , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand let themselves in . stocked with food and equipment . The shelter is well Brand is taking readings with a radiation detector . BRAND The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation . What happened here ? Cooper looks at the pieces of a modular , one-person rocket , a last-ditch means of escape , stored , untouched in the shelter . He steps back , realizing something . COOPER This is the Taichung mission . BRAND The Mars mission ? The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing . Cooper looks over the relay log . COOPER They never landed . Not on Mars . Four human crew , fifteen robots . The log says the base has been here for thirty years . Case 's familiar voice comes through the radio . CASE ( O.S . ) I 've found something . 74 . INT . UTILITY MODULE , CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT The structure is filled with drilling equipment . Cooper and the rest of the team stand at the edge of a three-foot hole that has been drilled into the ice . A descending rig is anchored to the top of the hole . Doyle and Case struggle to pull themselves out of the hole . DOYLE It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet , then stops . Tunnel 's old -the ice has reformed at the bottom . BRAND I 'm going to descend to take some samples . Cooper , want to make yourself useful ? Cooper begins to say something , then bites his tongue . EXT . LANDER -- NIGHT Cooper emerges , loaded down with several containers of Brand's equipment . As he struggles through the wind and snow , his radio picks up data chatter between the mother ship and Case . The comms are just noise . After a moment , Case 's voice cuts in . CASE ( O.S . ) Get back here , Cooper . We 've got a problem . Cooper continues to wade through the snow . Suddenly , he trips over something , dropping the equipment . Cooper looks back . He tripped on a white plastic post sticking out of the snow . He dusts it off , to reveal a picture of a Chinese Taikonaut smiling in his flight suit . This is a grave marker . Cooper sweeps his hand through the snow , revealing three more white posts with pictures . The entire human crew has been buried here . INT . UTILITY MODULE , CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT Roth and Case are looking at a portable monitor , showing a projection of the nearby system -- the ice planet is a speck orbiting the local black hole . COOPER The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow . 75 . Roth looks up from the monitor and assesses the situation with his usual detachment . ROTH I think I know what killed them . This planet is n't the only thing orbiting this black hole . Roth zooms the monitor in , revealing a tiny , impossibly-bright object appearing at the horizon of the black hole . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) It 's a neutron star . The black hole shields the planet 's surface from it for twenty hours at a stretch . Time's about up . Even Brand looks rattled . BRAND How long do we have left ? ROTH About five minutes . Then what ? COOPER BRAND Then we die . The radiation will cook us alive . Cooper looks around , their predicament settling in . walks over to the edge of the mine shaft . Case CASE We have to go down . COOPER What about returning to the ship ? BRAND Not enough time . Case is right . The ice can shield us from some of the x-rays . DOYLE It would take a thousand feet of ice to shield us . Brand gives up on the argument , sheds her equipment and clips herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice . Cooper looks at Doyle , then follows her . 76 . INT . ICE MINE SHAFT -- NIGHT Cooper descends into the shaft . suit 's light array . The only light is from his He reaches the bottom of the shaft , which opens into a small cave , the ice ribbed in wave-like patterns like the seafloor . COOPER What is this ? BRAND A pocket formed by gas . be more below . There may The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness . Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick . DOYLE We 'll never make it far enough down . Shut up . Roth ? BRAND How much time do we have , Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment . ROTH About three minutes or so until we're fully exposed . The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity -the radiation levels are rising . The ice will not be enough to protect them . Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick . He takes over for her . The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-yearold battery runs out of charge . Case casts it aside and begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand . Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket , looking for fissures . Her lights pick out something in the ice . She looks closer : Tiny black flecks . Brand , ever the scientist , forgets their predicament and begins chipping at the ice . BRAND I 've found something . Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand , which is badly smashed . 77 . He pulls off the hand and continues to hack away at the ice with the stump , trying to save his crew . Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands , which contains several black flecks . As she shines her light on them , they FLUORESCE , giving off a tiny flicker of light , like a firefly . Brand steps back . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) These things ... they 're alive . Roth joins her , looking down at the tiny creatures trapped in the ice . Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again , but nothing happens . Roth takes the depth meter dangling by a lanyard from Brand 's suit . ROTH It 's not your light they 're responding to . It 's this-Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice . Suddenly , the black flecks begin to shine . BRAND X-rays . They feed on them and emit visible light . They 've found a way to survive here . Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms trapped in the ice , mesmerized . Case hammers down with his arm , gouging a deep hole in the ice below . Suddenly , GAS sprays back up at him . He 's found the gas pocket beneath them . Too late . Roth 's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically . EXT . ICE PLANET -- ALIEN DAWN Overhead , a tiny ball is orbiting into view from the dark side of the black hole -- the NEUTRON STAR . Its humble size belies its power . the ice CRACKLES with energy . As its rays hit the ice , INT . ICE MINE SHAFT -- ALIEN DAWN Brand steps back from the ice in awe as it begins to glow . The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light . Within seconds , they are bathed in an incredible glow . Even Cooper stops , awed by the beauty of the display . Only Case is unmoved , continuing to SMASH at the ice with the broken end of his wrist . 78 . BRAND ( looks at rad meter ) They 're absorbing most of the x-rays . ROTH Not enough , unfortunately . Suddenly , a CRACK as Case punches into the ice . Cooper looks down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them . Case , wait -- COOPER Case PUNCHES again . Suddenly , with a great BANG , the ice floor disintegrates beneath them . They fall into the darkness . INT . CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN Cooper falls . For a moment , the only light he can see is from Case , falling calmly a few yards beneath him . As they fall , the light from the microbes trapped in the ice above sweeps across the inside of the cavern , illuminating the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down . The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the tip of a mountain range extending into the distance , disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover . The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea . On the far side of the sea , another mountain range stretches into the distance , supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof . Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling towards the huge inland sea below . Seconds before impact , a tiny warning light flickers on inside his helmet : IMPACT DETECTED . Suddenly , a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the back of suit , slowing his fall . Airbags EXPLODE on his legs and torso to cushion the impact . Cooper SMASHES into the water . BLACKNESS . EXT . UNDERWATER -- DAY Cooper comes to underwater , as liquid is flowing into his suit from his shattered helmet . 79 . Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet fills with water and he begins to sink . As he sinks , Cooper pulls off his helmet , then tears off pieces of his suit . He forces himself through the neck of the suit and then swims upward . He is about to surface when he remembers where he is . He hesitates , just beneath the surface , lungs tightening as he runs out of oxygen . EXT . SEA , ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper breaks the surface , COUGHS out water , and takes a panicked breath . He waits . Nothing happens . He opens his mouth again and breathes in almost pure oxygen . He can breathe . Treading water , he looks around . Spots lights in the water below nearby -- Brand , in her suit , is sinking . He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit . Cooper breaks the surface , looks at Brand . broken . Breathe . Her mask is also COOPER Trust me . She refuses at first . Water is bubbling into her suit through the open mask . Finally , she takes a deep breath . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Your suit is filling with water . I 'm not going to be able to hold it much longer . I 'm going to let go . Brand 's eyes widen . BRAND What do you mean , you 're going to let go ? COOPER Take a deep breath . Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her . EXT . UNDERWATER -- DAY Brand sinks . Cooper swims down , following her , ripping away at her suit . The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast , damaged in the fall . 80. Cooper finally breaks them off . Brand pulls herself out , free , and they swim for the surface . EXT . SHORE , ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach . He turns back to offer Brand a hand . She waves him off . BRAND I do n't need your help . COOPER I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism . She gives up and lets him help her out of the water . They sit together , soaking wet , trying to catch their breath . Thank you . BRAND COOPER Do n't mention it . Cooper feels the rocks beneath him , which are translucent , like glass , and polished to an impossible shine . He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle , still in their suits , out of the water . EXT . SHORE , ICE PLANET -- DAY Doyle and Roth have stripped down from their suits and are breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere . Case and Cooper are pulling modular pieces from their equipment packs to form a small shelter . Brand is taking readings with her instruments . BRAND Oxygen atmosphere . Pure water . Temperate climate . ( to Cooper ) You still think this is a coincidence ? Cooper looks at the tree line , less convinced . COOPER Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice . We're down to three suits . We 'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth . 81 . BRAND I wo n't need one . Why not ? DOYLE BRAND Because I 'm not going anywhere . This is our new home . Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and hikes into the jungle . EXT . SHORE , ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper finishes constructing the modest shelter . the suits and the rest of their gear inside . They load COOPER Any sign of Brand ? ROTH She 's still taking samples . If you find her , tell her to head back . Night should be falling soon . COOPER What happens then ? ROTH Your guess is as good as mine . Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand . EXT . JUNGLE , ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like lifeforms , which are wildly different from their counterparts back on Earth , piled in torturous coils , as if frozen in a struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above . BRAND This is incredible . The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb xrays and emit light . In return , these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen , which feeds the animals trapped in the ice . Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case . The transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically . She compares it with the flecks she collected in the ice above , fascinated . 82 . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Look at this . I think they 're the same organism at a different stage of the life cycle . ( shows him the sample ) It 's fractal . No individual cells -the structure repeats all the way down . Cooper looks at the sample , then continues scanning the jungle around them , nervous . COOPER Any sign of big life-forms ? BRAND The soil 's been disturbed . So something 's been moving . But I have n't seen anything . ( notices his look ) Cooper ... are you nervous ? Cooper stops scanning the trees , embarrassed . COOPER I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls . Overhead , the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the neutron star must have orbited out of view . Night is falling . BRAND ( laughing ) Relax . If there are any large organisms here , even predatory ones , they 're not going to attack us -they have no idea what we are . COOPER You do n't know that . You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden . Brand stops . He 's struck a nerve . BRAND ( truly pissed off ) Faith has nothing to do with it . You know what you are , Cooper ? You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no . ' That this is n't going to work . And frankly , I do n't have to convince you . 83. COOPER What 's that supposed to mean ? BRAND You 're on this mission because you're another pair of hands . You want the truth ? I told Case we should bring another robot over you . At least then I could just reprogram you toShe stops . Something has caught her attention . COOPER What ? BRAND Nothing . I just -- I could have sworn it just moved . She walks to the thick , knotted trunk of a tree . hand on it . Puts a Overhead , the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to descend , more rapidly than on Earth . Suddenly , the tree SHUDDERS . over Brand 's fingers . Then , the bark begins to ooze Brand snaps her hand away and steps back . Even for her , this is too much . She turns back to Cooper , who is looking at the jungle around them , spooked . COOPER You know how plants do n't usually move ? Is that a universal rule ? No . BRAND There really are n't any rules . All around them , the life-forms begins to melt toward the ground , breaking down into different , smaller forms . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) ( trying to stay calm ) Remember , we 're the aliens . Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Hold very still . Do n't make any sudden movements . Two of the pieces join together , stacking themselves up and staggering toward him . 84 . A third piece climbs onto the first two , looking for a good place to hang on . After a moment it hunkers down on top , forming a crude head . Thirty eye-like structures blink open on the creature . The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light like the animals trapped in the ice above , bathing Cooper and Brand in a warm glow . The creature creeps closer to them , taking them in . tries his best to seem non-threatening . Hello there . Cooper COOPER The creature lurches toward him on three legs , then its head splits open and it BELLOWS . OK. COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Now we run . Brand does n't argue . They turn and sprint through the trees . EXT . JUNGLE -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle . At first , they 're running from the rumbling , smashing melee behind them . But as they run , the entire jungle around them begins to break apart and move . After a moment , they 're surrounded . The jungle is completely disassembling itself into a million different pieces , each one a different size and shape than the others . COOPER We have to reach the shelter . They head off , crashing through the melee . EXT . SHORE , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Case , Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter finishing the day 's work . Doyle turns around . The jungle is breaking apart and crawling down the beach towards them . DOYLE I think we 've got a problem . Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed as they move towards them . Roth begins to step out towards them . 85 . Fascinating . ROTH I think- Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the shelter after Doyle . Case pushes the door closed . INT . SHELTER , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING at the walls , trying to force their way inside . It 's going to be a long night . EXT . JUNGLE , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Ahead , Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea , light still flickering in patches from the ice above it . This way . COOPER Brand begins to follow . No ... wait . BRAND Too late . Cooper forces his way between two writhing creatures , steps through , and falls ... EXT . WATERFALL -- NIGHT Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water . floats past . Brand The river appears to flow randomly down the slope , with good reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night . Ahead , the ground drops away again and the water rushes over it in a torrent . Cooper catches himself at the last minute , grabbing a thick tree branch with one hand and , a second later , Brand with the other as she slides past . COOPER I 've got you . Suddenly , the branch in Cooper 's hand illuminates and wrenches itself out of the rock -- it 's a limb of a huge colony organism . It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again ... 86 . EXT . POOL -- NIGHT Brand surfaces first . She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and out of the water . She smiles down at him , a little smug . BRAND I 've got you . Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them , as if imitating them . Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool . INT . CAVE -- NIGHT Brand CRACKS a glow stick , basking the cave around them in a soft light . As they watch , horrified , the pool and the rocks in front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes , as they tumble down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal . For a moment , it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed . Then , a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave . Another follows , and another , until the cave entrance is full . Cooper looks around the cave , frantic . He picks up a rock . Brand , scared but still thinking , takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the ground . BRAND It 's game theory . The best move is always to cooperate at first . COOPER By `` cooperate '' do you mean let it eat me ? BRAND These organisms have no interest in us . They survive by photosynthesis . All they need is light . COOPER Then why are they killing each other ? BRAND I do n't know . ( looks around ) But we 're outnumbered , Cooper . So unless you have a better idea , I suggest we make nice . 87 . The creatures move toward them hesitantly , then faster . Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around him . Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a better look at him . One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding at his shoulders , then his neck . COOPER ( trying to be calm ) What is it doing ? BRAND It 's a colony organism . It 's trying to incorporate you into its structure . COOPER I do n't want it to incorporate me . BRAND Do n't open your mouth . Why n- COOPER As he speaks , the creature on his chest extends four spindly , pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth . Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his teeth . Its skin has a roughened texture , as if incomplete , and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper 's skin , without much luck . Bored , the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper . The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper 's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human . After a moment , the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away . Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are left alone again . Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches , fascinated , as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) They 're killing each other . BRAND No . They do n't bleed ... they don't die ... they 're just competing ... trying out different shapes , looking for the best one . 88. Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking , five-legged beast stumbles past and tackles another animal . COOPER I 'd say they have a long way to go . BRAND ( amazed ) They do this every night . As they watch , a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw scuttles along the ground , grabbing smaller opponents and smashing them apart , then sorting through the wreckage and adopting some of the writhing parts as its own . Something about the movement is endearing , the way it experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set . Suddenly , a massive , lumbering creature SMASHES down in front of the claw beast . No match , the smaller creature turns to scuttle away . Too slow . The larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it . After a moment , it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one . The new organism lumbers away through the jungle , happily snapping its new claw at larger opponents . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) The behavior changes as the animals get bigger and bigger . More sophisticated . More calculated . Two of the larger organisms square off , circling each other , lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display . COOPER But what are they competing for ? BRAND I do n't know . Brand shivers -- it 's getting colder . INT . CAVE -- NIGHT Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them . Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her case . It 's moving around , splitting apart , reforming , trying to find a way out . 89 . BRAND These creatures are billions of years older than we are . But they're relatively primitive . They haven't developed tools , culture , language . Why not ? COOPER BRAND I do n't know . No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth . But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters . No impacts . It 's been sheltered by the local black holes . COOPER What difference would that make ? BRAND Maybe not enough has gone wrong here . Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life . COOPER ( quietly ) Murph 's Law . BRAND Exactly . Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top . Maybe that 's part of the plan . COOPER ( shakes his head ) The plan . BRAND Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us ? Cooper is silent for a moment . His mood darkens . COOPER I was in Denver during the first year of the famine . I was just a kid . We kept waiting for someone to come help us . People starved to death sitting on the ground , waiting for someone to come . ( MORE ) 90. COOPER ( CONT 'D ) ( looks at her ) I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us . We were on our own . Cooper looks away . The memories are never that far away . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Honestly ? After the things I saw ... you want to know why I do n't believe that someone would be trying to help us ? Because I 'm not sure we 're worth saving . They sit in silence for a while . EXT . CAVE -- NIGHT Cooper sleeps . the darkness . After a moment , Brand steps back out into EXT . PLAIN -- DAWN Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the temperature is well below freezing . The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above . The creatures are huge now , forty or fifty feet tall , battling each other more and more slowly . As Brand watches , the largest of them beats down his rivals , climbing to the top of the heap . Just as the beast reaches the top , it freezes , as if stuck . Above , the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter . Suddenly , the beast on top breaks apart , unfurling into planes to catch the light . This is what the contest has been about -a better place in the sun . Brand takes it in . EXT . JUNGLE -- DAY Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage , which is now perfectly still , absorbing the light . Cooper looks at the plants , wary . Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him . BRAND They 're not going to move now , Cooper . They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light . 91. Cooper leads the way , pushing through the trees . Suddenly he stops again . foliage to join him . Brand , annoyed , pushes through the BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Cooper , honestly , you 're a bit of aShe stops . Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff . Spread out on the plain below is a massive , fortified base . INT . CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY Massive blast doors , long since smashed in , open onto a building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife . Case steps inside first , his worklights flickering on . and the others follow him in . INT . Cooper MESS HALL , CHINESE COLONY -- DAY The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has covered the tables and chairs . Water pools on the floor and light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals have punched in the ceiling . DOYLE Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals . COOPER Looks like they lost . They continue through the ruins . INT . BARRACKS , CHINESE COLONY -- DAY The deeper they go , the less fractal wildlife they find . The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds , waiting for colonists who never came , like one of the bunkers the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter . DOYLE Look at the size of this place . They built it for thousands of people . But no one came . Brand looks around , determined . BRAND They will . We can salvage it . place will save us years . This 92. COOPER But why did n't they come ? BRAND ( shrugs ) The Chinese government collapsed , same as ours . The people who knew about this mission probably died years ago . We had the same problems . Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the science levels . INT . LABORATORY , CHINESE COLONY -- DAY A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive complex of underground laboratories . INT . DAMAGED LAB , CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab that has been completely emptied -- no desks , no chairs , nothing . The only thing that remains is a solid ball of matter in the center of the room . BRAND What happened here ? Roth stares at the ball , intrigued . ROTH They were testing something . Cooper looks at the walls , which are bowed inwards . COOPER Testing what ? Roth is looking at the ball , which appears to have been built from layers of different material . The outermost layer is flattened steel . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) ( looking closer ) Is that a chair ? Roth looks . The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks like a steel chair , flattened with incredible force onto surface of the ball . Brand opens the door to the next lab . 93 . INT . LABORATORY , CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT The lab is empty , except for a large metal sphere on a pedestal in the center of the room . A black box is set into a cavity in the sphere , wired to a control panel . Cooper looks at the walls of the room , which have been bowed inwards , as if some great force had been pulling from the center of the room . COOPER Everything in here is bolted down . ( looks at sphere ) What do you think this thing does ? ROTH ( excited ) Let 's find out . Roth finds a control panel . Wipes off an inch of dust and begins tinkering with the controls . COOPER I would n't turn it on until we can figure out what it does , Roth . Roth continues to look over the controls , oblivious . Cooper . BRAND ( O.S . ) Come look at this . Brand calls out from the hallway . INT . STAIRWELL , CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper follows Brand 's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement beneath the lab level . INT . OBSERVATORY , CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect holographic representation of the local system . Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map , looking at the incredibly detailed models of each star . Case is standing at a terminal , hacking into the camp's records . CASE I 've found the Chinese mission logs . They 're encrypted . Cooper walks over . Looks over the terminal . 94. COOPER Old military-grade encryption . not very robust . ( looks at Case ) No offense . Hang on . It's Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal . Opens up the terminal . Scans the motherboard . Takes Case 's rifle and SMASHES one of the chips on the board . The terminal comes to life . Cooper hands Case his rifle . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) That should open up most of it . Case is silent for a beat , parsing the information . CASE They got here twenty years ago . The human crew was killed by radiation the first day . But the robots survived . They built the colony and radioed home . But they did n't receive a response . COOPER No one was listening . CASE ( scans document ) After a few years they discovered a problem . DOYLE What problem ? CASE It does n't say . Their science team took the ship to continue exploring the system . It says they found some kind of ... ( translating ) ... The word literally means 'treasure . ' Case skims through the rest of the logs , large portions of which have been redacted . CASE ( CONT 'D ) The science team returned after five years with a new technology . They began the experiments upstairs , then they left again and never returned . 95 . BRAND Where did they go ? CASE I do n't know . They 've deleted their mission plan . There 's nothing else . DOYLE I think I know what the problem is . Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map , slowing down the passage of time , reversing it , speeding it up . Look . DOYLE ( CONT 'D ) Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a blur , speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel . DOYLE ( CONT 'D ) There 's a small black hole moving into the system . Too small for us to have seen in our survey . It's not going to hit the planet , but it 's going to come close . A tiny black hole soars through the system . Although it misses the ice planet , it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree . After a dozen more orbits , the ice planet dips down close to Pantagruel 's event horizon and is torn apart . Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats -the planet is pieced back together again and ejected , then pulled back in and torn apart . Over and over . DOYLE ( CONT 'D ) This place is n't paradise . It's doomed . Just like us . The crew stand , watching the sequence in stunned silence . COOPER How long does this place have ? A few years . CASE A decade at most . Doyle turns to Brand . DOYLE So much for the plan . Cooper looks at Brand . She is in disbelief , staring as a lifetime 's training and optimism are torn to pieces . 96 . BRAND But I do n't understand ... why are we here ? What are we here for ? Cooper looks down . Brand 's upset is turning to anger . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) What the hell are we here for ? I trained my whole life to reach this place . She looks at Cooper , questioning . COOPER ( gentle ) Maybe ... maybe Roth 's right ... maybe we just do n't understand it yet . She looks down . She knows he does n't believe what he's saying . He 's been right all along -- they 're alone . For a tiny moment , all hope is lost . Suddenly , with a distant RUMBLE , the building begins SHAKING . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Case , what is that ? CASE It 's nighttime . The native lifeforms are mobile again . The RUMBLE grows more intense , as if the entire building is being gently shaken . COOPER It 's closer than that . ( realizing ) Roth . No . The RUMBLE grows . free of the desk . in the air . As Cooper watches , Case 's rifle slides But instead of falling , it simply hangs Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his boots no longer have traction with the ground . After a second everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Quick -- hold onto something . He reaches out to Brand but it 's too late -- suddenly they're no longer floating , they 're falling . They 're falling up . 97. Cooper , Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling . Cooper picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is now down . He helps Brand up . DOYLE What the hell is happening ? Case does n't answer -- he 's looking up at the control equipment for the holographic display , which is GROANING under a load it was never built to handle . Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and CRASHES towards them . Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they 're being pulled up and sideways through the stairwell , like an Escher painting . Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control panel orbits past them back up towards the lab . They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible , dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs . Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the lab . Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab , SMASHING it open . Doyle disappears up and into the lab . Cooper slips trying to help Doyle . him ... Too late . INT . Brand reaches out for Cooper is pulled through the open door . INTACT LAB , CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel . He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel . He dangles , the panel cutting into the meat of his hand , trying to get his bearings : Roth , Doyle , and everything that has n't been bolted down is either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room or is orbiting around it . Roth , who is laughing , jubilant , shouts up to him : ROTH The control panel is beneath you . See if you can turn it off . 98. Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls . finds the controls for the machine . Finally he COOPER ( yells up ) I found it . Hold onto something . Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto the support wires . Cooper hits a key on the monitor . Suddenly , the room inverts again , reverting to a normal gravitational field . Cooper floats for a second , then topples back to the ground , along with everything else . Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life . INT . INTACT LAB , CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT Roth , back on terra firma , is looking at the tiny black box he 's pried from the center of the sphere . Cooper is looking over his shoulder . COOPER They found a way to make gravity . ROTH Not make it . Adjust it . Dial it up , or down . I think they were experimenting with it -- firing these into the black hole to try to save this planet . DOYLE All that from one tiny box . Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling through the incredibly sophisticated machine code , trying to parse how it works . Cooper looks on . ROTH ( amazed ) It barely uses any power . I 'm only beginning to understand what it does but I think it sends a signal out into the bulk . It must tap into the same technologies that were used to create the wormholes in the first place . COOPER What does that mean ? 99 . ROTH It means whoever built the wormhole probably does n't exist inside our universe . Cooper looks at the tiny box . COOPER But how did the Chinese develop the technology ? This would take decades , maybe hundreds of years , to create . CASE Wherever they went , they found something that allowed them to build it . Brand looks at the box . ROTH They came back here and tried to use these devices to save this planet . But they did n't work . Nothing would be strong enough to weaken a black hole . BRAND Maybe we could work with it . improve it . Try to ROTH No . You 're missing the bigger picture . The robots had strict mission parameters . They were told to build a colony and report back . They tried to . But they failed . Like us they were fixated on this place . Cooper looks at Brand . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) They did n't realize they had already found something that would save us all . ( holds up the box ) This . This is the prize . He holds up the box . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) Do n't you see ? Earth 's gravity is like a prison . But this is like a master key . ( MORE ) 100 . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) If we could build more of these , we could turn down the earth's gravitational field enough to save millions of people . We wouldn't have to pick a handful of people to survive . With this we can save everyone . BRAND And go where ? ROTH Wherever we want . We do n't belong in any one place . Ca n't you see that now ? Not Earth . Not this place . Nowhere . If the human race is going to survive , we need to keep moving . Split up . Spread out . Fly . With this , we can . Case looks at the box . Makes a decision . CASE In the morning we 're taking this and going home . Doyle , Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave -gathering space suits , equipment . In the bustle , Cooper finds Brand sitting alone , staring at the sample of fractal life . COOPER I know this is n't exactly what you trained for . But I think Roth might be right . BRAND That does n't help this planet . This creature is doomed . Unlike us it does n't have anywhere to go . The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her , trying to comprehend . But it quickly loses interest and goes back to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different shapes , trying to escape . Brand sets it back down . CUT TO : INT . BARRACKS , CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Morning . Cooper and the others prepare to head out . They are laden down with gear -- space suits for the return trip to the lander once they reach the surface . 101 . Roth carries the gravitational prototype . EXT . ENTRANCE , CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY They make their way through the ruined entrance . CASE We need to hurry . We only have a few hours to reach the ice before nightfall . Cooper stops . He puts a hand on Brand 's shoulder . to the tree line . Something is moving . He points COOPER Do n't make any sudden movements . They ca n't hurt us if we 're unarmed . Who ? BRAND Suddenly , three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle , weapons raised . They are wearing ghillie suits , pieced together from dried dead pieces of the local foliage . Under their camouflage , they looks identical to Case . one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias . With Case steps protectively in front of his team . The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward , rifle levelled . CHINESE OFFICER Ni Hao . My name is Technical Sergeant Liu , 177th reconnaissance Marines , Army of the People 's Republic . Welcome to New China . ( polite ) Please put down your weapon . Sergeant Liu speaks in the same even tones as Case -- they were probably built in the same factory before the war . Case keeps his rifle raised . CASE This is a scientific expedition , not a military one . We are making our way back to our ship . LIU I 'm afraid I can not let you do that . We will provide food and shelter and await further instructions . ( MORE ) 102 . LIU ( CONT 'D ) We are sorry if this causes you any inconvenience . The sergeant is polite , but firm . BRAND This planet is being pulled into the black hole . We all need to leave . LIU We will await further orders . COOPER Further orders are n't coming . Your government is gone . It ran out of money , same as ours . You 're on your own . LIU We can offer you food and shelter as long as you require . The facilities here are quite comfortable . Liu 's tone remains polite , but there 's no hope of changing his mind . Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand . COOPER ( low ) They 're never going to let us go . BRAND ( to Liu ) Your mission is a humanitarian one , was n't it ? You were sent to start a colony . Like us . LIU Our mission was to prepare for the evacuation . This site was deemed unacceptable . BRAND This device that you have built -this could save millions of people . We need to get it back home . Brand points to the device Roth is holding . The Chinese robots seem particularly unhappy with this development . LIU These technologies are the property of the People 's Republic . ( MORE ) 103 . LIU ( CONT 'D ) We have been ordered to prevent anyone from taking them . We have been ordered to prevent anyone from following . Following ? ROTH Following where ? Liu pauses . LIU We will await further orders . ROTH Your name means six . Where did the others go ? One through five ? Is that who were not supposed to follow . Case turns to look at Cooper . CASE ( low ) Take the others up to the lander . Keep going . No matter what happens , do n't come back for me . Cooper nods . Case moves . Fast . He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot , disabling it , then hurls himself at the remaining two , tackling them both over the edge of the ravine . Cooper watches them disappear into the void below . Brand and the others . Come on . Grabs COOPER Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins hiking up the mountain . EXT . MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY The crew hike towards the ice above . Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits something else -- Case is still fighting . They keep moving . EXT . UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT They are high above the Marine camp , only fifty feet or so below the massive ice roof of the cavern . The Chinese have blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp above . 104 . This high , the air is bitterly cold . Cooper and the others are hunkered down , trying to keep warm , waiting for night to fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without being cooked by the neutron star . Finally , above them , the light begins to flicker out . crew begin pulling on their space suits . The Brand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case -she is bringing it with them . Cooper catches her eye . BRAND We ca n't leave them all to die . She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice . EXT . SURFACE , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Brand leads the way , the lights from her suit cutting into the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the lander . As they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from the ship . He raises Case 's weapon . One of Liu 's marines steps around from the back of the lander . Cooper FIRES . The marine collapses . Cooper and the others race to the lander . BRAND Was that the last of them ? DOYLE We 're not going to stick around to count them . Let 's get out of here . COOPER We 're too late . Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship 's hull -- the marine has torn open a section , revealing damaged hardware . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) The main thruster fuel supply . not going anywhere . Cooper looks down . We're They 're stuck here . DOYLE What about the escape rocket at the Chinese base camp ? One of us could fit into it . 105 . BRAND It does n't matter how many of us make it . We have to get this back to earth . Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead . ROTH Can the secondary thrusters still fire on the lander ? Doyle looks over the craft . DOYLE Sure . But we do n't have nearly enough power for lift off . Roth holds up the small gravity black box . ( smiles ) Yes we do . ROTH Roth sets off running towards the Chinese base camp . EXT . CHINESE BASE CAMP , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the shelter . Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces up and they snap together , forming a crude two-stage rocket designed more for a robot than a man . When it 's complete Roth wedges himself inside , clutching the black box -- he barely fits . ROTH I can reach one of the moons in low orbit and turn up its gravity . As it passes overhead it should be able to slingshot the lander away from the planet 's surface . ( looks around ) Along with everything else . COOPER But we need to take the box back to earth . ROTH You do n't need this -- only the idea . The knowledge of how to build it . Cooper remembers something . Heads back into the shelter . 106 . INT . CHINESE BASE CAMP , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Roth follows Cooper into the lab . Cooper opens the storage crate . Picks one of the probes at random . Sets it down on the bench next to Roth . Cooper begins rigging up a connection between the two . COOPER I 'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe 's hard drive . It 'll be garbled , but it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back . Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data . Not me . ROTH But you 'll make it work . The transfer is complete . Roth hands Cooper the probe , and takes the black box himself . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) This is a one-way trip for me . Before Cooper can respond , Roth heads for the door . EXT . CHINESE BASE CAMP , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Roth squeezes himself into the rocket , hugging the black box to his chest . Cooper and Brand help him . BRAND This is n't right , Roth . We can find a way for all of us to leave . ROTH This is the only way . Keep the lander upright and fire the secondary boosters when the moon passes overhead . COOPER Let me take it . ROTH No . You need to make it home . You're going to need to build more of these . Brand looks at him , heartbroken . Roth smiles . 107 . ROTH ( CONT 'D ) I understand the plan , now . Whatever happens , you have to keep exploring . Keep learning . One good idea isn't enough . You 'll need more and more of them just to survive . Do you understand ? ( nods ) Thank you . Go . BRAND ROTH Brand turns to follow Cooper back . Behind her , Roth 's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud . In seconds it 's high overhead . EXT . LANDER -- NIGHT Cooper checks over the hull , which is intact . Doyle is inside looking over the controls . He steps back outside . DOYLE Control systems inside are online . ( looks up ) I 've lost sight of the rocket . Do you think he made it ? COOPER We 're going to find out soon enough . Brand is looking off into the distance . BRAND Someone 's coming . Cooper looks up . A robotlike figure is limping through the snowstorm towards them . Cooper raises the rifle . Finally he makes out the insignia -- it 's Case . Cooper and Doyle run out towards him . They reach Case as he collapses in the snow . He 's badly injured -- one leg torn off at the knee , one arm mangled . Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship . INT . LANDER -- NIGHT They drag Case into the lander . controls . Doyle checks over the ship's 108 . DOYLE Close the door . Cooper moves to the door . Something 's wrong . COOPER Where 's Brand ? She 's nowhere to be seen . Cooper looks out onto the ice . Brand is heading back out into the snow . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Dammit . If I do n't make it back , just keep going . ( points to probe ) Get that thing home . Cooper steps to the door . EXT . SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting the ice planet . The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's surface -- the tiny moon does n't provide enough gravity to attract it . When the rocket is close enough , Roth detonates the explosive bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon 's surface . He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface . Behind him , the rocket smashes apart against the surface . Roth finally gets a good hold . He looks down . Below him , the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving into the distance , Gargantua rising over its horizon . Roth looks at the black box in his hands . EXT . SURFACE , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper catches up with her . She is digging in the snow . He takes her arm but she wo n't go . She finally finds what she 's looking for -- the sample case . The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom . Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander . 109 . EXT . MOON , SPACE OVER ICE PLANET Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him . He finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it punctures the ice near the Chinese camp . For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet . He takes a final breath and activates the black box . Instantly , the moon 's gravity is magnified a hundred million times over . Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses around him into a tiny sphere . EXT . SURFACE , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander . Suddenly , the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE . Cooper turns back . A mile back the ground begins to tear apart , heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky . Roth 's moon is racing overhead , TEARING up a massive strip of the surface 's planet as it nears them . Cooper and Brand run . EXT . MOON , SPACE OVER ICE PLANET The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible -millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb . The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the moon , rocketing up from the planet 's surface . EXT . LANDER , SURFACE , ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper has almost made it back to the lander . Brand stumbles . He turns back . Behind him , Brand is pulling herself up . Behind her , the THUNDEROUS EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet 's surface is hurled into space have almost reached them . Cooper looks at the ship . He 'll never make it if he waits for Brand . He turns back to find her . He reaches Brand just as the moon 's gravity hits them -they 're hurtled off into space . He grabs her hand . Seconds later , everything -- the entire ice sheet , the sea and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them . 110 . Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin atmosphere . Brand looks at him . BRAND ( radio ) You caught me . Now what ? Cooper looks around . pieces around them . They planet 's surface is breaking into COOPER ( radio ) I do n't know . ( radio ) I figured if you were floating out into space , you 'd want some company . He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the planet 's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them . BRAND Between you and utter solitude , Cooper , frankly , I 'm not sure . They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the planet begins to win out . For a moment they float . COOPER Guess you were right -- too much gravity , or not enough . He smiles , forgetting their predicament for a moment . stare into each other 's eyes . They Then they begin , very gently , to fall back towards the ice planet . Suddenly , the lander maneuvers beneath them . opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm . The airlock Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard . INT . LANDER Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards . Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending into space as the debris around them begins crashing back down towards the ice planet . Cooper looks out the window : 111 . The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's surface as it circles out of view . Roth . He 's gone . COOPER BRAND Ahead , a shadow looms in the darkness : the Endurance . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE Brand , Cooper , and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock and scramble to take control of the ship . Below them , the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the neutron star 's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of Pantagruel . Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out . Its sole remaining engine FIRES , rocketing the ship back towards the dark side of the planet , out of view of the neutron star , and back towards the original wormhole . DOYLE I 'm setting a course for the wormhole . They 're going to make it . Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny awkward smile . He returns it , then descends below . INT . OUTER HULL , ENDURANCE Cooper props Case up against the workbench . He pulls down replacement arms and legs from storage bins . Unwraps them from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto Case 's chassis . Cooper finishes attaching the arm . the function . Case rotates it , checking COOPER How is that working ? CASE Very well , thank you . COOPER Good . We 've already set the course , skipper . We 're going home . Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level . 112 . INT . OBSERVATION LEVEL Doyle is setting the controls . The ALARMS on the controls have finally abated -- they 're out of the danger zone . BRAND We 're safe now . Cooper heads to the communications equipment . COOPER Now I know why we were n't able to hit the relay . It 's not interference -the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be . Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment . BRAND ( conflicted ) Cooper , wait-The ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole . There is no response . COOPER Nothing . ( thinks ) Wait . The ship cached one long garbled transmission when we first fell into the swirl . If we account for the blue shift then the computer might find something in there . Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received . The computer begins re-analyzing it , piece by piece . BRAND ( quiet ) Listen to me -- the blueshift also means we 've lost time . More time than we thought we would . Cooper looks up at her . How much ? COOPER BRAND A lot ... Cooper , maybe it 's best if we don'tThe comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet . another . Then 113 . Then a FLOOD of communications , one packet a day , hundreds and hundreds of packets : images , videos , audio messages from family and friends . Cooper watches , horrified , as the images play out across the screen . He is watching the lives of his family play out at light speed . Finally , the packets slow , then stop . Cooper looks at the results , in shock . COOPER Forty seven years . Doyle joins him , staring at the screen , stunned . My kids ... DOYLE Cooper tries to PING the relay again . Nothing comes back . BRAND ( gentle ) The relay will have lost power years ago . That 's why we could n't contact it , even after we reached the planet . Cooper is still problem solving , thinking . COOPER We could bypass the relay . Send a conventional shortwave signal . BRAND Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole . Besides , no one will be listening anymore . The comms screen is dead . No movement . Nothing . Cooper looks at Brand , realizing something . COOPER You knew , did n't you ? You and Case figured it out when we landed . Brand looks down . BRAND I thought ... I could n't be sure . COOPER Sure you could . You 're brilliant . You know everything . 114 . BRAND Cooper ... we needed to keep going . I 'm so sorry . Your children ... COOPER They 're not children any more ... if they 're even still alive . He turns away from her . BRAND Listen , the important thing is that we 're going home , now . And we have something that can save everyone . It 's more important than the people we left behindDoyle cuts her off , filled with anger . DOYLE That 's easy for you to say . did n't leave anyone behind . You Cooper looks at Brand , his anger softened by sadness . Yes she did . COOPER Brand looks at him , grateful for this small kindness . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) That 's why you were upset -- your father . She looks down , filled with sadness . BRAND He 's gone . But there are other people who still need our help . There's still time ... The ship 's controls TONE in ALARM . Brand and Cooper turn : Case is standing at the controls . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Case ... what are you doing ? Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls . Presses the `` execute '' button . The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Wait ... no ... 115 . The robot turns from them . Cooper notices that the control module snapped into the back of Case 's chassis is wrong : It 's red with a gold star . It 's not Case at all . LIU I 'm sorry . I have my orders . one follows ... It 's Liu . No Liu stares , satisfied , as the nuclear engine spins away from the ship and back down toward Pantagruel . Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind . The robot tumbles to the ground , the fight gone out of him . Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for his control module . LIU ( CONT 'D ) No one followsCooper rips the module out . The robot freezes . Brand is already at the controls , trying to regain control . The instruments TONE , alerting the crew to their position : The ship is spinning back down towards the black hole . BRAND No ... We 're being pulled back to Pantagruel . Cooper , frantically checks the controls , firing the remaining boosters . COOPER We ca n't let that happen . We'll lose more time ... too much ... The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black hole below them . On the ship 's guidance , they watch , helpless , as the ship climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit . As on their first trip , the black hole grows to dominate the bottom of the sky , and the stars above them become streaks -time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the deep gravity well around the hole . As they watch , trapped , decades begin to play out in the system above them . They watch as the ice planet whirls around them , orbiting the black hole dozens of times . 116. COOPER ( CONT 'D ) We 're losing years . Finally , the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction . As it reaches it slows , until finally it reaches the event horizon , just as they saw in the projections . Nothing has prepared them for the reality : The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence . Brand looks at the sample of fractal life . Now they are united -- they are , in all likelihood , the sole survivors of their planet . Doyle points to the instruments . DOYLE The wormhole . Look -- it 's being pulled into the black hole as well . They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole 's orbit converges on the event horizon of the black hole . BRAND It 's orbit mirrored the ice planet 's . COOPER What will happen to it ? BRAND It 'll be destroyed , like everything else . Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications screen . Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast . Brand opens her mouth to point out that it 's futile , then stops . COOPER ( into radio ) This is the crew of the Endurance . We ... ( gives up on formalities ) Murph , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I didn't make it back , like I promised . He hangs up the radio . In silence , they watch as the wormhole -- their only way home -- vanishes beneath the event horizon . DOYLE How much time are we losing ? 117 . BRAND ( heartbroken ) Decades ... hundreds of years . COOPER All of those people back home ... none of them will make it . As Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral towards the black hole . This is it . in . DOYLE We 're going to be pulled Cooper looks at the controls , an idea forming . He pulls himself down . Hauls himself across the deck to pick up Liu 's chip . He plugs it into a diagnostic tool .

Brand studies the trajectory . BRAND We can use the thrusters to keep us on the critical orbit . Then slingshot us towards Gargantua . The thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the critical orbit . 118 . Suddenly , the tidal gravity SLAMS them against the walls of the ship . Finally , the thrusters fire again -- a tiny push , but just enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole , like a rock out of a slingshot . The ship races toward the massive hole in the sky below them : Gargantua EXT .

DOYLE We only have a few minutes before we 're swallowed into that thing . What are we even looking for ? On the radar , a tiny empty spot appears . COOPER ( points to screen ) That ? What is it ? Brand looks . In one tiny region on the back side of the black hole , the debris simply seems to vanish . BRAND It 's another wormhole . Doyle FIRES the thrusters again , pushing the ship towards the wormhole . EXT . SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA The Endurance spins , shifting paths slightly as it continues to race closer and closer to oblivion . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE They study the controls . The projected path shifts , one degree at a time . Finally , it appears to put them on a path to hit the wormhole . Doyle shuts off the thrusters . 119 .

It is massive , much larger than the first wormhole , and it 's glowing with a light as bright as a star . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE The crew brace themselves against the hull of the ship . Suddenly the ship slams onto the wormhole mouth and is pulled violently into the wormhole . WHITENESS . As the light fades , Cooper and the others come to . The light is rapidly dimming from pure white , fading to a deep red , then infrared , finally darkness . Cooper looks out . Checks the instruments . Looks out again . EXT . VACUUM Nothing .

Bittersweet . BRAND Maybe that 's enough . He turns away from her . She takes his shoulder . She pulls him into a kiss . His surprise disappears and he pulls her to him , kissing her back . Their surroundings forgotten , they drift . She LAUGHS gently as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it , sending them spinning back into the center of the cabin . She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space . In moments , the cabin is filling with discarded clothes , different colors and shapes , like a ticker tape parade . In the center of the cabin , Brand and Cooper make love . INT . CREW QUARTERS , ENDURANCE -- LATER Cooper and Brand embrace , sleeping , drifting in the cabin . Suddenly , Doyle 's voice calls out from the other cabin . DOYLE ( O.S . ) It 's happening ... it 's happening again ... Get up here ... Cooper wakes , careful not to disturb Brand . He plucks his shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on . 126 . INT . OBSERVATION DECK , ENDURANCE Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin . standing in the middle of the chamber . Doyle is DOYLE They just appeared . A sphere of distortion , like the one they encountered in the first wormhole , is directly in front of Doyle , hovering at a point in the middle of the cabin . Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere , which grows in response . Brand pulls herself into the cabin . Several more points appear , as if they 've been summoned by the first . Some of the points twist , some of them spin , and some of them are motionless . BRAND I think these are the creatures that built the wormhole . One of them begins to move closer to Cooper . COOPER This thing is made of ... gravity ? BRAND No . I do n't think it 's in our universe at all . I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse . And it can only interact with us using gravity . The shape playfully grows around Cooper 's hand , bending the space it 's in , stretching the skin . Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body , coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso like a fun house mirror . Suddenly , the sphere wrapped around Cooper 's hand begins moving , tugging him gently through the cabin . In the next moment , all three of them are being propelled through the cabin . It 's a magical moment -- a communion , a dance between creatures on either side of a massive , invisible wall . Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled around the room . 127. Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the bulk beings move them through space . They hold onto each other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the whirling dance continues . Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage , a tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin . The creature breaks apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure . Finally , Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself around the lab , looking for some way to try to communicate with the creatures . She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves them close to each other , then far apart . The bulk beings soon join her , mimicking the motion of the pieces of equipment . COOPER Can we communicate with them ? BRAND Where would we even start ? Maybe -- She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open , releasing a cloud of the tiny shining globes into the air . For a moment , nothing happens . Then , the distortions begin moving through the bearings , shifting them , rearranging them into patterns in the air . First , they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters , then shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around a medium-sized star . DOYLE That 's our solar system . After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and rearrange into a larger , more complicated system -- Gargantua , Pantagruel , and the ice planet . Finally , the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet . Inside the sheet , one solitary ball bearing orbits around the stars and then pushes up , off of the sheet , into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet . COOPER What is that ? Brand looks at the tiny particle , floating alone above its universe . 128 . BRAND That 's us . That 's where they've brought us . We 're in the bulk . Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle . now . The map is static Cooper looks around . The distortions have gone . instruments on the ship TONE in alarm . The Cooper walks through the map , sending the ball bearings scattering . He hurries to the instruments . The ship is moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) They 're moving us . Where ? DOYLE They stand , looking out into the perfect darkness . EXT . ENDURANCE , VACUUM The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness : a tiny point of light . As they grow closer , they realize that it 's an opening . They are inside a massive , hollow sphere . They have been the entire time . The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of the sphere . Below them is an astonishing sight : Our entire universe , compressed into a flattened disc , like a floor of stars . They are hovering above it , in the bulk , the space between universes . INT . ENDURANCE , BULK Brand and the others stare at the incredible display . The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive hollow sphere between them and our universe , lower and lower until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere . In the distance , they can make out a cluster of lights . COOPER There 's something out there . The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer : 129 . It 's a massive space station , built onto the surface of the sphere . EXT . SPACE STATION The Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper decks of the space station . After a moment , the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and the others step out , in their suits . They walk up to the airlock doors of the station , which open automatically . INT . SPACE STATION After the airlock decompresses , the inner doors open . Standing there , waiting for them , is a familiar figure : Tars . TARS ( deadpan ) I guess this is n't robot heaven after all . The light on his brow glows and he offers them both a hand . INT . GRAND LABORATORY , SPACE STATION The humans have taken off their space suits -- the station has been built to be habitable by humans -- and are following Tars through the massive facility . TARS I orbited the black hole seven times before I hit the second wormhole . Then I drifted until I found this place . Cooper looks around . The halls are filled with countless technological wonders . COOPER This is what the Chinese were protecting . ( looks around ) How they could have built all this in just a handful of years . TARS They did n't . It took them four thousand . ( off Brand 's look ) Time moves very slowly here 130 . BRAND How do you know ? TARS Because I 've been waiting for you for three hundred years . Brand looks around at the massive facility . BRAND Time . That 's what the bulk beings wanted to give us . That was the treasure the Chinese found . Enough time to let us save ourselves . Brand looks around . The facility is massive . She sets the specimen case down on a table . Even the tiny creature seems in awe of the place . INT . LABORATORY , SPACE STATION Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine . It is tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each other with a tiny force . TARS I have catalogued almost everything they had built here . COOPER Must have taken you a while . TARS One hundred and fifty-seven years . Cooper shakes his head in disbelief . COOPER How are they keeping the lights on in this thing ? Tars , in answer , points to a far door . Follow me . TARS INT . ENGINE ROOM , SPACE STATION A massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy contained within it . The whole room HUMS with power . Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell : A tiny black hole spins , spewing out massive amounts of power . 131 . TARS It 's a mini black hole . A remnant of the big bang . It will power this place forever . Tars leads them on . EXT . HANGAR , SPACE STATION Tars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft . Cooper starts to stop , but Tars does n't slow down . INT . SIMULATION ROOM In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of the Earth , perfect down to the tiniest detail . It 's a map ? COOPER TARS No . Not a map . This is a simulation of the Earth . A perfect simulation . Tars touches the control panel . The map zooms in over Europe . Down onto Paris . Late 20th century : People walk through the streets . to buy a newspaper . A woman stops at a newsagent Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out . TARS ( CONT 'D ) They tested each of the technologies hundreds of times , trying to find the one that would cause the least damage and still allow us to leave Earth . Suddenly , the map lights up with atomic explosions in every city . The sequence stops , rewinds . This time , sped up , the Earth seems to be drying up -- great swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia . Massive circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth . TARS ( CONT 'D ) This was their best solution . A massive version of the box we found on the ice planet , allowing the entire human population to escape . At a given moment , the gravity of the Earth is dropped to nothing and the massive ships , filled with the entire 132. population of the Earth , lift gently off of the planet in search of greener pastures . Cooper turns away from the machine , bitter . COOPER So why did n't they return ? they save us ? Why didn't Brand is staring at the massive map . BRAND Because they were too late . By the time they found this place , the people who sent them were dead . They were unable to fulfill their mission . Tars points to the next room . TARS That was the final problem they tried to solve . Tars moves on . EXT . PLATFORM , SPACE STATION Above them , the blackness of the sky is punctuated with hundreds of crystal shapes , faintly leaking starlight : Wormholes . Brand looks up at them , entranced . BRAND Where do they lead ? Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall , mapping some of the wormholes . TARS There are millions of them , connecting virtually every planetary system in the universe . There are thousands in our galaxy alone . But the Chinese stopped mapping them when they found what they were looking for . Tars walks further . He stops . The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet , connected to a massive power array , and pointing into the dark space above the sphere . 133 . TARS ( CONT 'D ) This was their final creation . They had to capture the mini black hole just to have enough power to try it . Several miles above the black box , one of the wormholes glows far brighter than the others , crackling with radiation . DOYLE What does it do ? Cooper steps forward . Runs a hand on the cold , strange material the antenna is made out of . He knows exactly what it does . COOPER They were n't interested in the other wormholes because their mission was to return home . That one leads back to Earth . The Earth they were told to return to . Tars walks to the controls for the device . BRAND But that 's impossible ... Tars turns away from the machine . TARS It was only used once . The Chinese team attempted to travel back in time , to Earth just a few years after they had left . COOPER Did they make it ? TARS I do n't know . Doyle looks back to Cooper . DOYLE Do you really think it works ? Cooper looks up at the machine , suddenly determined . COOPER We 're going to find out . Cooper walks out of the room . Brand follows him . 134 . EXT . AIRLOCK , SPACE STATION Brand follows Cooper as he walks up to the Endurance . BRAND You know it does n't work . is n't possible . Time travel COOPER You do n't know that . BRAND Yes , I do . If it worked , the Chinese would have suddenly discovered all of these incredible technologies . But they never made it . ( beat ) You ca n't go back , Cooper . You can slow things down , but you ca n't ever go back . Our home is gone . ( off his look ) You listened to all of those messages from your family . If you had made it back , we would already know . There would already be some evidence . Cooper looks at the machine . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) If you try to use it , you 'll die , just like the people who built it . She puts an arm on his shoulder . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Roth was right , Cooper . We have to keep going . Keep exploring . We have an obligation to try to survive . From here we could find a thousand places where life could thrive . And you 're going to return to the one place where it ca n't . COOPER I made a promise . He turns away from her , resolute . EXT . HANGAR , SPACE STATION Cooper and Doyle check over one of the sleek Chinese spaceships . 135 . INT . CHINESE SPACESHIP Cooper is checking over the controls of the ship . walks in . Brand BRAND I came to say goodbye . Cooper looks up at her . INT . HANGAR , SPACE STATION Cooper walks Brand back to the Endurance . The ship is packed up and repaired . Brand is looking over their work . COOPER You could have taken one of the other ships . BRAND This one 's done all right by us so far . Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the fractal life-form . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) Will you take this with you ? It's the last of its kind as well . Thought we should double its chances of survival . In case I 'm wrong . Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside , trying to escape . He sets it inside the ship . Turns back to her . COOPER Where are you going to go ? BRAND I do n't know . Up there , I guess . She points up into the great darkness above them . Tars steps down . Moves over to them . COOPER You 're going , too ? TARS I 'm curious . It 's my nature . you down the road ? Tars shakes Cooper 's hand . See Heads onto the Endurance . 136 . BRAND Come with us . Please . You wanted your whole life to explore . This is your chance . Cooper stares at her . This is what he has always wanted . And he has to turn it down . COOPER I 'm sorry . I have to find out what happened to my sons . I promised them . Brand sees the resolve in his eyes . change his mind . Knows there 's no way to BRAND You 're a man who keeps his promises . Make me oneShe takes his hand . BRAND ( CONT 'D ) After you 're done ... come find me . I promise . COOPER They kiss passionately . Not wanting it to end but knowing that it must . Reluctantly , they separate . Brand turns back to the ship . She pulls herself onto the ship . Cooper steps back outside and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts off and disappears into the darkness . Cooper turns away . EXT . PLATFORM , SPACE STATION Cooper watches as radiation pours out of the wormhole high above them . INT . CHINESE SPACESHIP Cooper pulls himself on board . Doyle is at the controls . He keys the controls and the ship lifts off . DOYLE Let 's go home . The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the space station and closes in on the wormhole . Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP . He turns around : 137 . The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely into one of the seats , filled with the garbled machine code of the gravitational machine . The probe ... COOPER Doyle looks back . DOYLE We get back to earth , you and I can try to make sense of the code . Rebuild the gravity machine . Cooper stares at it , suddenly realizing something . unbuckles himself . He Cooper stands and walks over to the probe . Traces the familiar stars and stripes carved into its side . Cooper stares at the probe , putting it all together . COOPER It 's going to work . DOYLE Of course it 's going to work . COOPER That 's not what I mean . This is the probe I found in Galveston . Below them , the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity well , creating a time machine . The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) Brand said there 'd be some evidence we 'd made it . And there was . This . ( holds up probe ) But only this . Everything will be destroyed except for this . He moves toward Doyle . Doyle stands . COOPER ( CONT 'D ) We have to stop . DOYLE I do n't know what you 're talking about , but you 're not touching the controls . I 'm going home . 138. Cooper moves closer to Doyle . gun . Points it at Cooper . Doyle pulls out the flair COOPER You do n't need to do this . We won't make it back , but this does . The secrets are already right on it . Maybe someone found it . There's hope . ( sad ) But we do n't get to go with . DOYLE You 're not stopping me . home . I 'm going Doyle forces Cooper into the ship 's lander . the airlock . Then he closes Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass , trying to reason with him . The landing craft detaches from the ship . INT . CHINESE LANDING CRAFT Cooper watches , helpless , as Doyle 's ship races ahead towards the glowing wormhole mouth . As the ship speeds toward the next wormhole , the radiation suddenly FLARES , annihilating the ship and everything in it . Almost everything . Cooper 's landing craft spins away from the wormhole mouth . CUT TO : EXT . SPACE , OUR SOLAR SYSTEM A hole opens in the sky with a FIERY EXPLOSION . As the radiation subsides , all that shoots out of the hole is a vaporous wisp of atomized metal , and a burned , blackened probe , which hurtles toward Earth . EXT . SPACE , NEAR EARTH ORBIT The probe collides with a satellite , hurling debris into the upper atmosphere . PROBE 'S ONBOARD CAMERA P.O.V . -The probe 's onboard camera documents its journey . of video : Fragments 139 . -- The probe HURTLES through the atmosphere , toward North America , the Gulf Coast . -- The probe SMASHES down into a sandbar . -- Daylight . A man is descending toward it , dangling from a rope . It 's Cooper . -- Night . A kitchen . A little boy -- Murph -- stares at the probe , while Cooper works at it with a blowtorch . -- Tars pulls the probe out of the back of a plane . -- Brand 's father , older , studies the probe . Gives up . -- Much later . People are moving around in the darkened base , scavenging equipment . CUT TO : EXT . FIELD -- DAY A combine harvester is dead in a field , service hatch opened . A MAN is lying under the machine , working . The man hauls himself out from under the huge machine . himself off . Dusts It 's Murph , 30s . He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for the verdict . Murph shakes his head . MURPH It 's done . Auto-pilot 's packed up for the last time . FARMER You ca n't make it work a little longer ? MURPH Ca n't do anything for you . There are n't any more parts for these . Not anywhere . FARMER You do n't understand . We 're getting less than a hundred pounds per acre . We need to plant more , not less . Murph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that stretches around them . The plants are feeble , barely able to support themselves . 140 . FARMER ( CONT 'D ) You 've got to find us some more parts , Murph . It 's getting desperate . Is n't there anywhere you can look ? Murph begins packing up his tools , thinking it over . INT . HANGAR -- DAY Murph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp . He stares at the tarp , unsure if he wants to keep going . He pulls the tarp off , revealing Cooper 's old Piper Cub . He checks over the engine , lights , prop . Turns the key . Fires her up . The diesel wakes with a GRUNT . EXT . AIRSTRIP -- DAY Murph wheels the old plane out onto the field by hand . EXT . SKIES OVER THE SOUTHWEST -- DAY The ancient plane skirts the San Gabriels . EXT . FIELD , SANTA CRUZ ISLAND Murph sets the plane down . He parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down . He scans the horizon . Nothing . Is this the place ? EXT . FOREST -- DAY Murph pushes his way through the undergrowth . Stops .

The place has been gutted . almost everything . Thieves and scavengers have taken Murph finds one of the robots , or what 's left of it -- it's been stripped , leaving only the bare composite skeleton . The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph . Murph looks around the place . There is nothing left to salvage . He turns to leave . Hears a familiar CHIRP . In the corner , under a pile of rain-soaked garbage : 141 . The probe . No one has bothered to steal it . Murph stares at it . INT . UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe that survived the looting . He hooks the probe up to it . After a minute , the screen fills with a picture of an icecovered planet . Then nothing . The rest of the probe 's drive is filled with garbage , noise . Murph switches off the screen . He stands . Begins to leave without the probe . back . Picks it up and takes it with him . INT . Stops . Turns KITCHEN , MURPH 'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Murph is hunched over the probe , trying to pull data off of it with a defibrillator . He has incorporated an ancient laptop into the chain , and is tweaking values on it , trying to decrypt the contents . His WIFE , several months pregnant , turns back to him from the stove . MURPH 'S WIFE Would you get that thing off of the table ? Murph nods , absorbed . Keys in a final tweak to the decryption software . Hits return . Suddenly , the screen begins filling with data . Murph stares at it , wide eyed . CUT TO : INT . BARN -- NIGHT Murph , now in his 40s , is putting the finishing touches on a large machine . Although slightly different , we recognize some of the components and their configuration : It 's a crude version of the gravitational device . Murph double checks it , then fires up a small gas powered generator . Throws a breaker , feeding power to the unit . The unit lights up . HUMS . But nothing happens . 142 . Murph , disappointed but undaunted , shuts it down and begins checking it over . He hears a noise at the door . Turns back . His daughter , Emily , 8 , is standing at the door . EMILY COOPER Dad ? You said you 'd take us to the game . MURPH ( distracted ) Did I ? He looks at the impossible nest of wires . All right . Shakes his head . MURPH ( CONT 'D ) Let me get my jacket . Murph picks up his jacket from the workbench . Next to it on the bench is a shortwave radio playing STATIC . EMILY COOPER ( staring at machine ) What is it supposed to do , Dad ? MURPH I have no idea . Murph switches off the lights and they walk out . After a moment , the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness . COOPER ( over radio , garbled ) This is the crew of the Endurance ... Murph ... I 'm sorry ... The signal crackles out . CUT TO : INT . KITCHEN , MURPH 'S HOUSE -- DAY Murph , 50s , slightly gray , sits at his kitchen table . hears a distant RUMBLE . He looks up . His wife is standing by the sink . MURPH Where 's Emily ? WIFE Out in the barn . She 's been tinkering with your old projects . He 143 . Murph stands up . The roof of the barn is visibly shaking . He steps outside . EXT . YARD , MURPH 'S HOUSE -- DAY Murph moves towards the barn , concerned . The shaking is growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling . Emily , now 18 , backs out of the barn . EMILY COOPER Dad ... I 'm sorry ... I made some changes to the machine . I think I did something wrong . Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch , the entire barn IMPLODES . Their tractor begins sliding towards the wreckage of the barn , chunky tires plowing up the soil . Finally , the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in a FIERY display . As the dust clears , Murph and his daughter examine the mess : The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball . Murph looks at his daughter . MURPH Do you remember what you changed ? Wide-eyed , she thinks about it . Then nods . CUT TO : EXT . EARTH , 2320 -- DAY This is North America . But it does n't look much like it . Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean . Most of the vegetation is gone , and unchecked winds sweep across the barren plains . Patches of ice lie think on the ground , as if a heavy snow has come and gone . SUPER TITLE : `` TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER '' One of the Chinese spaceships descends through the thick clouds above and settles gently onto the plain . The hatch opens and Cooper steps out . He takes a cautious look around . He is holding the fractal life in its small container . The clouds are threatening , but the weather looks calm enough right here . 144. Cooper starts to walk . EXT . COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY Remarkably , part of Cooper 's old house is still standing . INT . COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen . Two walls are missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap . But he can still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast . He has kept his promise . Several hundred years too late . Cooper hunkers down , staring at the space where his kids used to be . Rainwater covers the ancient formica . It has taken him years to finally reach this place . He has had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find . But nothing has prepared him for this : He is completely alone . Nothing is left . INT . COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits . Unchecked by trees or vegetation , the wind rockets through the house , blasting Cooper and pelting what 's left of the structure with fist-sized hail . Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall . He 's going to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the brutal descendants of the weather he knew . They 'll finish him off if he steps back outside . As he watches , the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes over in seconds . INT . COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN Cooper shivers , pressed against the wall . The storm is still raging outside . He is freezing to death . He has to move now or he will die . He pulls the hood tight around his face and stumbles outside . EXT . SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow . He tries to find his way , but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard . He stumbles to the ground , dropping the glass case with the fractal wildlife in it . The case shatters . Cooper tries to stand back up , but his strength is dwindling . 145 . As he watches , the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out of its broken habitat . It forms together against the cold . After a moment , it burrows into the ice . As it does , the ice glows faintly . It seems to be right at home . Cooper laughs , glimpsing the outline of a plan . Was this what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along ? Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the driving snow . He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles a few more steps , then stumbles again , spent . Finally , he sits down in the snow to die . As his senses flicker in and out , he is struck with memories of his boys , so vivid he reaches out for them , crawling forward in the snow . He stops , and laughs , remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die . He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet , eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship . Cooper takes a final step . Finally , he collapses under his ship , as the wind continues to HOWL around him . As the snow clears for a moment , Cooper is alone on a vast arctic tundra . He will die alone . BLACK FADE IN : INT . HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY Cooper wakes . He is in a sunlit room . A breeze rustles the curtains as it makes its way in through a large open window . Cooper sits up . As he a does , a control panel on the wall TONES gently , as if in response to his movement . He stands and looks around . He can see sunlight through the open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play . He moves toward the window . Reaches for the curtains . Before he can , the door opens behind him . A WOMAN in a white coat steps in , smiling warmly . DOCTOR Good morning . Do n't go outside just yet , Mr. Cooper . ( MORE ) 146 . DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) ( offers him a pill ) This will help with the disorientation . Cooper opens his mouth to talk , but his voice is cracked . He gives up . Swallows the pill . DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) Wait a minute for that to take effect . It can be a bit of an adjustment . ( looks him over ) You had some frostbite . Nothing too serious . As she talks , Cooper looks past her to the window . Where am I ? COOPER DOCTOR ( smiles ) It 's a bit of a coincidence , really . When the rangers found you , we were the nearest facility . COOPER What 's coincidence ? place ? What is this DOCTOR We have a lot to show you . The doctor reaches for the curtains . She offers him a hand . Cooper declines the help and steps outside . EXT . HOSPICE , COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields . But as the road and the buildings stretch into the distance , the landscape curves up , not down . The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylindershaped space station . Cooper stumbles , and reaches instinctively out . catches him . DOCTOR You 're OK. We get this from people who move here from planetary colonies all the time . The doctor 147. COOPER Where ... where are we ? DOCTOR Like I said . It was a coincidence . There was a facility closer to Earth , but they had a problem , so you wound up here . ( off his look ) This is the Space Station Joseph A. Cooper . Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings . A thousand feet above them , black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass . DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) I 've got someone who wants to meet you . Cooper looks at her . INT . INTENSIVE CARE ROOM , HOSPICE , COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper steps inside . The room is dark , still , the only noise is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe . Cooper steps closer to the bed . thin . He is ancient . The man 's skin is paper- DOCTOR He was moved here after they found you . He 's a little old for a transfer , but they made an exception . Cooper hovers at the back of the room , unsure . He turns to the doctor , questioning . Then he notices the pictures on the old man 's desk : There are dozens of them . Children , grandchildren . Then the older ones -- the man 's own parents . Grandparents . Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes : Murph , 80 years old , surrounded by his daughter and her family . They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape Canaveral , and a huge spaceship under construction . Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it . The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's leg in the picture . That 's him . DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) 148 . She points to the old man lying in the bed . DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) His name is Anthony Welling . Anthony Cooper Welling . ( smiles ) He 's your great great grandson . He 's been waiting a long time for you . Cooper 's eyes well with tears . He steps over to the bed and looks down at the ancient man , teetering on the edge of death . The old man looks at him , eyes widening in excitement . He strains , trying to reach the bedside table . He 's trying to reach the drawer . Cooper helps him open it . Inside is a simple , familiar wristwatch . The old man carefully takes out the watch . He gives the watch a few winds and , hands shaking , offers it to Cooper . Cooper , eyes filling with tears , closes his hand over the old man 's hand , enveloping both the watch and the man 's hand . CUT TO : EXT . CORNFIELD , COOPER STATION -- MORNING Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office . A middle-aged BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk . ADMINISTRATOR You 're a hero , Mr. Cooper . Let's just start off by saying that . It's an incredible and ... unexpected honor to have you here with us . Cooper smiles , uncomfortable . ADMINISTRATOR ( CONT 'D ) None of us would be here without the efforts of you and the other crewmembers of the Endurance . ( smiles , unconvincingly ) So I do n't want you to take this the wrong way . But there are some questions I 've been told to ask . The man looks petrified , like he 's been instructed to grill George Washington on his expense reports . Shoot . COOPER 149 . ADMINISTRATOR The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild . Which is , unfortunately , against regulations . COOPER It was last of its kind . was destroyed . Their planet The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer . ADMINISTRATOR The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form , but it had already spread out of control . It seems to be thriving . He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america . A considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing . Cooper begins laughing . less comfortable . Which makes the administrator even ADMINISTRATOR ( CONT 'D ) Can you tell me why you ... elected to release the life-form back on earth ? Cooper is still laughing . COOPER Because that was the plan . Whose plan ? ADMINISTRATOR COOPER ( smiles ) I do n't know . The administrator tries to smile back . his file . Changes the subject . Makes a few notes in ADMINISTRATOR My assistant tells me you 've applied for a position with the exploration fleet . COOPER Feel like I should be pulling my weight . 150 . ADMINISTRATOR That 's admirable , Mr. Cooper . The truth is , most of the fleet's personnel are automated . There are a small number of crewed ships . But there are great numbers of candidates . Very well trained candidates . COOPER I was hoping to enroll in a course . Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems . ADMINISTRATOR I do n't want you to take this the wrong way , Mr. Cooper -- like I said , you 're a hero . But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources . Cooper remembers this conversation . He looks down . COOPER No one 's heard anything from Brand ? ADMINISTRATOR I 'm sorry . Officially , she 's been listed as missing for over 200 years . Mind you , I guess you turned up eventually , did n't you ? COOPER Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her ? I just need a small ship . I made a promise . The bureaucrat looks down . Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land ? ADMINISTRATOR Listen . Mr. Cooper . You 're a hero . You 're the oldest man in the human race . Do n't you want to take it easy ? ( off his look ) I hope you understand , we all you hold you in the highest possible regard . ( quiet ) Which is why they 're never going to let you go off by yourself in a spaceship . I 'm sorry . Cooper looks at his hands . He 's got a couple centuries on the bureaucrat in Earth years , but looks ten years younger . He puts his hands in his pockets . 151 . ADMINISTRATOR ( CONT 'D ) I 've got some good news , however . ( big smile ) We all know about your early life , Mr Cooper . I wrote a paper on it when I was a boy . And I think we found something you 'll really enjoy . EXT . CORNFIELD , COOPER STATION -- DAY Corn blows in an artificial breeze . A red tractor makes its way through the field , which curves gently up in the distance . ADMINISTRATOR ( V.O . ) The machines do most of the work , of course , but we were able to get you a few acres . You 're going to be a farmer again . After a moment , the tractor stops . Cooper climbs down from the seat . Looks at the front steering linkage , which is jammed with an errant tree branch . He wipes his forehead and begins working the branch out of the machine . He looks miserable . A robot , a similar unit to Tars , walks over . a bottle of water . Cooper accepts it . Offers Cooper EXT . HANGAR BAY , COOPER STATION Cooper stands on an observation deck , high above the hangar floor . Below him , bright young things in uniforms climb into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out . EXT . BASEBALL DIAMOND , COOPER STATION Cooper sits in the stands , listening to the familiar crack of the bat as an intramural team from the university practices . Cooper watches . He looks bored . The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly . For a second , the catcher shuffles back and forth , trying to get himself into position . But the ball never returns . The catcher YELLS out a warning . Above , the ball begins to slowly fall up , not down , toward the town center above . After a second , the ball smashes through a skylight of a building high above them .

1993;"Scripts.com Jurassic Park By Michael Crichton Page 1/139 1EXTJUNGLENIGHT An eyeball , big , yellowish , distinctly inhuman , stares raptly between wooden slats , part of a large crate . The eye darts from side to side , alert as hell . A legend tries to place us - ISLA NUBLAR : 120 MILES WEST OF COSTA RICA - - but to us it 's still the middle of nowhere . It 's quiet for a second . A ROAR rises up from the jungle , deafening . The trees shake as something very , very large plows ahead through them , right at us . Every head gathered in this little clearing snaps , turning in the direction of the sound as it bursts through the trees . It 's a bulldozer . It drops its scoop and pushes forward into the back end of the crate , shoving it across the jungle floor towards an impressive fenced structure that towers over an enclosed section of thick jungle . There 's a guard tower at one end of this holding open that makes it look like San Quentin . The bulldozer pushes forward into the back end , the crate THUDS TO THE FLOOR . A door slides open in the pen , making a space as big as the end of the crate . Nobody moves for a second , A grim-faced guy who seems to be in charge ( Robert Muldoon , although we do n't know it yet ) . MULDOON : Alright now , pushers move in . Loading team move it . The movement as agitated whatever is inside the crate , and the whole thing shivers as GROWLS and SNAPS come from inside . Everyone moves back . MULDOON ( cont 'd ) Alright , steady . Get back in there now , push . Get back in there , Do n't let her know you 're afraid ! The men go back to the crate and begin to push it into the slot . The crate THUDS UP AGAINST THE OPENING . A green light on the side of the pen lights up , showing contact has been made . FROM INSIDE THE CRATE , we get glimpses of what 's on the other side of those wooden slates - - jungle foliage , MEN with rifles , searching searchlights . The view is herky-jerky as the crate put into position . MULDOON : the gate . Page 2/139 A WORKER climbs to the top of the crate . The search lights are trained on the door . The RIFFLEMEN throw the bolts on their rifles and CRACK their stun guns , sending arcs of current CRACKING through the air . The WORKER gets ready to grab the gate when all at once - A ROAR from the inside the crate , and the panel flies out of his hands and SMACKS into him , knocking him clear off the crate . Now everything happens at once . The WORKER THUDS to the jungle floor , the crate jerks away from the mouth of the holding pen flash , an alarm BUZZER sounds - - - and a claw SLASHES out from inside the crate . It sinks into the ankle of the WORKER . dragging him toward the dark mouth between the crate and the pen . The WORKER SCREAMS and paws the dirt , leaving long claw marks as he is rapidly dragged toward the crate . Muldoon SHOUTS orders : MULDOON : Tasers get in there , Goddamn it ! They FIRE their guns - the wood of the crate SPLINTERS . Muldoon runs in and grabs the WORKER , trying to pull him free . The wild arcs of currents from the stun gun flash and CRACK all around , but in a second - - - the WORKER is gone . CUT TO : 2 EXTMOUNTAINSIDEDAY MANO DE DIOS AMBER MINE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC DONALD GENNARO , forty , in a city man 's idea of hiking clothes and a hundred dollar haircut , approaches on a raft being pulled across a river by TWO MEN . On the hillside , JUAN ROSTAGNO , thirty-ish , Costa Rican , a smart-looking guy in workers clothes , is waiting for him . ROSTAGNO : Tengo mil pesos que dicen que se cae ( I have a thousand pesos that say he falls ) ( or ) Apuesto mil pesos que se cae . ( I bet a thousand pesos he falls ) Gennaro finally lands , and Rostagno helps him off the raft . GENNARO : Hola , Juanito Page 3/139 ROSTAGNO : Hola , bienvenido Rostagno leads Gennaro towards the mine . Dozen of shirtless WORKERS claw and SCRAPE at a rocky mountainside that is the site of an extensive mining operation . The work is all done by hand , pick and shovel instead of dynamite and bulldozer . GENNARO : here ? ROSTAGNO : He sends his apologies . GENNARO : You 're telling me that we 're facing a $ 20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me ? ROSTAGNO : He had to leave early to be with his daughter . getting a divorce . She's GENNARO : I understand that . ( or ) I 'm sorry to hear that . We 'd be well advised to deal with this situation now . The insurance company - Gennaro almost falls , Rostagno helps him . GENNARO ( cont 'd ) - -the underwriters of the park feel the accident raises some very serious questions about the safety of the park , and they're making the investors very anxious . I had to promise I would conduct a thorough on-site inspection . ROSTAGNO : Hammond hates inspections . They slow everything down . GENNARO : Juanito , if they pull the funding , that will really slow things down . ( or ) If they pull the funding that 's going to slow things Page 4/139 down around here . A WORKER hurries up to them and busts into the conversation , breathless . WORKER : ( to Rostagno ) Jefe , encontramos otro mosquito , en el mismo sitio . ( Chief , we found another mosquito in the same place ) ROSTAGNO : Seguro ? Muestrame ! ( Are you sure ? Show me . ) The WORKER and ROSTAGNO scramble back deeper into the mine . Rostagno calls back over his shoulder to Gennaro . ROSTAGNO ( cont 'd ) It seems like it 's going to be a good day after all . They found another one ! C'mon . Gennaro struggles to keep up . 3 EXTCAVEDAY ROSTAGNO and GENNARO move into the dark , dripping cave , where at least a dozen other WORKERS are gathered in a tight circle , staring at something intently . Rostagno fights his way to the center of the group . One of the WORKERS hands him something and Rostagno examines it carefully . It 's a chuck of amber , a shiny yellow rock about the size of a half dollar . GENNARO : If two experts sign off on the island , the insurance guys 'll back off . I already got Ian Malcolm , but they think he 's too trendy . They want Alan Grant . ROSTAGNO : Grant ? You 'll never get him out of Montana . GENNARO : Why not ? ROSTAGNO : Because he 's like me . He 's a digger . Rostagno turns and holds the amber up to the sunlight streaming through the mouth of the cave . With the light pouring through it , the amber is translucent , and we can see something inside this strange stone - - Page 5/139 - - a huge mosquito , long dead , entombed there . ROSTAGNO : ( smiles ) Hay que lindo eres vas hacer a much gente feliz . ( Oh you 're so beautiful . You will make a lot of people happy ) CUT TO : 5 EXTTHE DIGDAY An artist 's camel hair brush carefully sweeps away sand and rock to slowly reveal the dark curve of a fossil - it 's a claw . A dentist's pick gently lifts it from the place its has laid for millions of years . Pull up to reveal a group of diggers working on a large skeleton . All we see are the tops of their hats . The paleontologist working on the claw lays it in his hand . GRANT : ( thoughtfully ) Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area . . . the same time horizon - ELLIE : They died together ? GRANT : The taphonomy sure looks that way . ELLIE : If they died together , they lived together . Suggests some kind of social order . DR ALAN GRANT , mid-thirties , a ragged-looking guy with intense concentration you would n't want to get in the way of , carefully examines a claw . DR ELLIE SATTLER , working with him , leans in close and studies it too . She paints the exposed bone with rubber cement . Ellie in her late twenties , athletic-looking . There 's an impatience about Ellie , as if nothing in life happens quite fast enough for her . Her face is almost pressed up against his , she 's sitting so close . GRANT ( cont 'd ) They hunted as a team . The dismembered tenontosaurus bone over there - that 's lunch . But what killed our Page 6/139 raptors in a lakebed , in a bunch like this ? come up with something that makes sense . ELLIE : A drought . We better The lake was shrinking - - GRANT : ( excited ) That 's good . That 's right ! They died around a dried-up puddle ! Without fighting each other . This is looking good . From the bottom of the hill a voice SHOUTS to them : VOLUNTERR ( o.s . ) Dr Grant ! Dr Sattler ! We 're ready to try again ! Grant SIGNS and sits up , stretching out his back . GRANT : I hate computers . He shoves the claw absent-mindedly into his pocket and he and Ellie walk toward the source of the voice . As they walk , we get our first look at the badlands . Exposed outcroppings of crumbling limestone stretch for miles in every direction , not a tree or a bush in sight . In the dig itself , the ground is checkered with excavations everywhere . There 's a base camp with five or six teepees , a flapping mess tent , a few cards , a flatbed truck with wrapped fossils loaded on it , and a mobile home . There are a dozen VOLUNTEERS of all ages at work in various places around the dig . The Volunteers are from all walks of life , dinosaur buffs . Three or four of them have CHILDREN with them , and the kids run around , like in a giant sandbox . Grant , Ellie and a Volunteer walk down the hill . Grant spots a KID kicking dirt onto one of the digs . He notices and frowns . GRANT : What 's that kid doing ? ( to the kid ) What are you doing there ! ? Excuse me ! Can you just back off ? This is very fragile ! Are you out of your mind ? Get off that and go find your parents ! ( to Ellie ) Did you see what he just did ? The kid stomps away , pissed off . KID : Page 7/139 Asshole . GRANT : ( to Ellie ) Why do they have to bring their kids ? ! ELLIE : You could hire your help . But there 's four summers of work here , with the money for one . And you say it 's a learning experience , sort of a vacation , and you get volunteers with kids . He and Ellie arrive to where several VOLUNTEERS are clustered around a computer terminal that 's set up on a table in a small tent , its flaps lashed open . GRANT : ( to the Volunteer ) Ready to give it a shot , Jerry ? A LITTLE GIRL moves a little too close to the machine . ELLIE : Want to watch the computer ? Ellie quietly moves her out of Grant 's way , to a place she can see . VOLUNTEER : Thumper ready ? MAN : Ready . VOLUNTEER : Fire . The VOLUNTEER throws a switch on a machine that looks a bit like a floor buffer . The whole thing hops up into the air as it drives a soft lead pellet into the earth with a tremendous force . There is a dull THUD , the earth seems to vibrate , and all eyes turn to the computer screen - ELLIE : How long does this usually take ? VOLUNTEER : It should be immediate return . You shoot the radar into Page 8/139 the ground , the bone bounces back .... The screen suddenly comes alive , yellow contour lines tracing across it in three waves , detailing a dinosaur skeleton . VOLUNTEER : This new program 's incredible ! A few more years of development and you do n't have to dig any more ! Grant looks at him , and his expression is positively wounded . GRANT : Well , where 's the fun in that ? VOLUNTEER : It looks a little distorted , but I do n't think that's the computer . ELLIE : ( shakes her head ) Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments . ( to Grant ) Velociraptor ? GRANT : Yes . Good shape , too . Five , six feet high . I'm guessing nine feet long . Look at the - He points to part of the skeleton , but when his finger touches the screen the computer BEEPS at him and the image changes . He pulls his hand back , as if it shocked him . VOLUNTEER : What 's you do ? ELLIE : He touched it . Dr. Grant is not machine compatible . GRANT : They 've got it in for me . The Volunteer LAUGHS and touches a different part of the screen , which brings the original image back . Grant continues , but does n't get as close . GRANT : Look at the half-moon shaped bone in the wrist . wonder these guys learned to fly . Page 9/139 No The group laughs . Grant is surprised . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Now , seriously . Show of the hands . How many of you have read my book ? Everyone stops laughing and looks away . Ellie raises her hand supportively . So does the Volunteer , Grant sighs . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Great . Well maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds than reptiles . Look at the public bone - - it 's turned backwards , just like a bird . The vertebrae - - full of hollows and air sacs , just like a bird . Even the word raptor means `` bird of prey '' . The kid steps forward and looks at the computer skeleton critically . KID : That does n't look very scary . More like a six-foot turkey . Everyone sort of draws in their breath and steps aside , revealing the KID , standing alone . Grant turns to the Kid , lowers his sunglasses , and stares at him like he just came from another planet . Grant strolls over to the KID , puts his arms around his shoulders in a friendly way . GRANT : Try to imagine yourself in the Jurassic Period . ( or ) Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous Period . Ellie rolls her eyes . ELLIE : ( under her breath ) Here we go . GRANT ( cont 'd ) You 'd get your first look at the six-foot turkey as you move into a clearing . But raptor , he knew you were there a long time ago . He moves like a bird ; lightly , bobbing his head , And you keep still , because you think maybe his visual acuity 's based on movement , like a Trex , and he 'll lose you if you do n't move . But no . Not VELOCIRAPTOR . You stare at him , and he just stares back . That 's when the attack comes - - not from the front , no , from the side , from the other two raptors you did n't even know were there . Page 10/139 Grant walks around the Kid . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Velociraptor 's a pack hunter , you see , he uses coordinated attack patterns , and he 's out in force today . And he slashes at you with this - He takes the claw from his pocket and holds it at the front of the raptor 's three-toed foot . GRANT ( cont 'd ) - - a six-inch retractable claw , like a razor , on the middle toe . They do n't bother to bite the jugular , like a lion , they just slash here , here - He points to the Kid 's chest and thigh . GRANT ( cont 'd ) - - or maybe across the belly , spilling your intestines . Point is , you 're alive when they start to eat you . Whole thing took about four seconds . The Kid is on the verge if tears . GRANT ( cont 'd ) So , you know , try to show a little respect . And with that he walks back across the camp , returning to his skeleton . Ellie hurries to catch up with him . ELLIE : You know , if you really wanted to scare the kid you could 've just pulled a gun on him . GRANT : Yeah , I know , you know ... kids . those ? You want to have one of ELLIE : Well , not one of those , well yeah , a possibly one at some point could be a good thing . What 's so wrong with kids ? GRANT : Oh , Ellie , look . They 're noisy , they 're messy , they're sticky , they 're expensive . ELLIE : Cheap , cheap , cheap . GRANT : They smell . Page 11/139 ELLIE : Oh my god , they do not ! GRANT : They do smell . They do n't smell . Some of them smell .. babies smell . ELLIE : Alright , the one on the airplane had an accident , but usually babies do n't smell . GRANT : They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous . ELLIE : The what ? GRANT : The Cretaceous . ELLIE : Anything else , you old fossil ? GRANT : Yeah , plenty . Some of them ca n't walk ! ELLIE : It frustrates me so much that I love you , that I need to strangle you right now ! Ellie playfully takes Grant 's hat off and gives him a tight hug . They kiss . A strange wind seems to be whipping up . Grant and Ellie look around , confused . The wind is getting stronger , blowing dirt and sand everywhere , filling in everything they 've dug out , blowing the protective canvasses off . Now there 's a more familiar ROAR , and they look up and see it - - - a huge helicopter , descending on the camp . ELLIE : ( to the volunteers ) Get some canvasses and cover anything that 's exposed ! Grant 's already on it , trying to desperately to protect the skeleton he 's excavating . He looks up at the helicopter and SHOUTS , Page 12/139 shaking his fist . CUT TO : 9 EXTBASE CAMPDAY Down at the base camp , the helicopter has landed . The PILOT is already out , waiting as GRANT comes down from the mountaintop like Moses steaming . Grant gestures wildly at him to turn the chopper off . The pilot points timidly to a mobile home across the camp . Grant runs to the trailer . 10 EXTTRAILERDAY The door to the trailer SLAPS open , and GRANT storms in . GRANT : What the hell do you think you 're doing in here ? The trailer serves as the dig 's office . There are several long wooden tables set up , every inch covered with bone specimens that are neatly laid out , tagged , and labeled . Farther along are ceramic dishes and crocks , soaking other bones in acid and vinegar . There 's old dusty furniture at one end of the trailer , and a refrigerator . A man roots around in the refrigerator , his back to us . GRUMBLING about the contents which are mostly beer . His hand falls across a bottle of expensive champagne in the back . MAN : Ah hah ! He pulls it out - the cork POPS . The Man turns around . JOHN HAMMOND , seventy-ish , is sprightly as hell , with bright , shining eyes that say `` Follow me ! '' Grant stares incredulously at the Man , holding his champagne bottle without an invitation . GRANT : Hey , we were saving that ! HAMMOND : For today , I guarantee it . GRANT : And who in God 's name do you think you are .... ? HAMMOND : John Hammond . And I am delighted to finally meet you Page 13/139 in person Dr Grant . Grant is struck silent . He shakes his hand , staring dumbly . GRANT : Mr. - - Hammond ? Hammond looks around the trailer approvingly , at the enormous amount of work the bones represent . HAMMOND : I can see my fifty thousand a year as been well spent . The door SLAPS open again and ELLIE comes in , just as pissed off as Grant was . ELLIE : Okay , who 's the jerk ? GRANT : Uh , this is our paleobotanist , Dr Ellie ..... ELLIE : Sattler . Grant Dr Sattler . Ellie , this is Mr. HAMMOND . ( in case she did n't catch it ) John Hammond . ELLIE : Did I say jerk ? HAMMOND : I 'm sorry for the dramatic entrance , but I 'm in a hurry . Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then ? Hammond begins to walk into the kitchen , making himself at home . Ellie follows him tries to help . Grant settles behind the table . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) Come along then , do n't let it get warm ! ( expansively ) Come on in , both of you . Sit down . As Hammond moves , they notice he walks with a slight limp and uses a cane - - for balance or style , it 's hard to say witch . ELLIE : I have samples all over the kitchen . ( she takes some stones out of one of the glasses ) Page 14/139 HAMMOND : Come along . I know my way around a kitchen . Come along . Ellie goes around towards Grant . She grabs a bottle of water . They look at each other , really aback by this guy 's bravado , and site down . Hammond dries the glasses . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) Well now , I 'll get right to the point . I like you . Both of you . I can tell instantly with people ; it 's a gift . ( new subject ) I own an island . Off the coast of Costa Rica . I leased it from the government and spent the last five years setting up a kind of biological preserve down there . Really spectacular . Spared no expense . It makes the one I had in Kenya look like a petting zoo . No doubt that sooner or later our attractions will send ( drive the ) kids right out of their minds . GRANT : And what are those ? ELLIE : Small versions of adults , honey . He gives her a dirty look . HAMMOND : Not just kids - - for everyone . We 're going to open next year . Unless the lawyers kill me first . I don't care for lawyers . You ? GRANT : I , uh , do n't really know any . We - - HAMMOND : Well , I 'm afraid I do . There 's one , a particular pebble in my shoe . He represents my investors . He says they insist on outside opinions . GRANT : What kind of opinions ? HAMMOND : Not to put a fine point on it , your kind . Let 's face it , in your particular field , you 're the top minds . If Page 15/139 I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know , give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - ( he Americanizes him pronunciation ) - -schedule . ELLIE : Why would they care what we think ? GRANT : What kind of park is it ? HAMMOND : ( smiles ) Well , it 's - - right up your alley . ( hands Grant a drink ) Look , why do n't you both ( the pair of you ) come on down for the weekend . Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well . ( hands Ellie a drink ) I 've got a jet standing by at Choteau . ( he jumps up and sites on the counter ) GRANT : No , I 'm sorry , that would n't be possible . discovered a new skeleton , and - - We 've just HAMMOND : ( pours himself a drink ) I could compensate you by fully funding your dig GRANT : - - this would be an awfully unusual time - HAMMOND : For a further three years . Grant OOFS as Ellie elbows him hard in the ribs . ELLIE : Where 's the plane ? CUT TO : 11 EXTCAFEDAY DENNIS NEDRY is in his late thirties , a big guy with a constant Page 16/139 smile that could either be laughing with you or at you , you can never tell . He sits at a table in front of a Central American cafe , eating breakfast Another Legend : SAN JOSE , COSTA RICA Nedry looks up and sees a man get out of a taxi - - LEWIS ( Louis ) DODGSON , fiftyish , wearing a large straw hat and looking almost close to him and scans the cafe furtively . Nedry laughs , shakes his head , and waves to him . NEDRY : Dodgson ! Dodgson hurries over to the table . DODGSON : ( as he sites ) You should n't use my name . NEDRY : Dodgson , Dodgson . ( loud ) We got Dodgson here ! See , nobody cares . Nice hat . What are you trying to look like , a secret agent ? table , and slides it towards Nedry , DODGSON : Seven fifty . DODGSON ( cont 'd ) On delivery , fifty thousand more for ever viable embryo . That 's one point five million . If you get all fifteen species off the island . NEDRY : Oh , I 'll get 'em all . DODGSON : Remember - - viable embryos . they do n't survive . They 're no use to us if NEDRY : Page 17/139 How am I supposed to transport them ? Dodgson pulls an ordinary can of shaving cream from a shoulder bag he carries and sets it on the table . DODGSON : The bottom screws open ; it 's cooled and compartmentalized inside . They can even check it if they want . Press the top . Nedry presses the top of the can and real shaving cream comes out . He grins , impressed . While Dodgson talks , Nedry looks around for somewhere to wipe the shaving cream and ends up dumping it on top of someone 's Jell-O on a dessert tray next to him . DODGSON ( cont 'd ) There 's enough coolant gas for thirty-six hours . Nedry looks at the can . NEDRY : What ? No menthol ? DODGSON : Mr Nedry , Mr Nedry . The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then . NEDRY : That 's up to your guy on the boat . Seven o'clock tomorrow night , at the east dock . Make sure he got it right . DODGSON : I was wondering , how are you planning to beat the security ? NEDRY : I got an eighteen minute window . Eighteen minutes , and your company catches up on ten years of research . A WAITER arrives and puts the check down on the table , between them . Nedry looks down at it pointedly , then up at Dodgson . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) Do n't get cheep on me Dodgson . Dodgson rolls his eyes and picks up the check . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) That was Hammond 's mistake . 13 EXTOPEN SEADAY A helicopter , `` IN-GEN CONSTRUCTION '' emblazoned on the side , Page 18/139 skims low over the shimmering Pacific . 14 EXTHELICOPTERDAY GRANT , ELLIE , GENNARO and MALCOLM are huddled in the back of the chopper ; HAMMOND is in the front with the PILOT . There are two other passengers was well -- DONALD GENNARO , the lawyer from the amber mine , now dressed in safari clothes , everything straight from Banana Republic . The other Dr. IAN MALCOLM , fortyish , dressed all in black , with a snakeskin boots and sunglasses . Malcolm , who finds it hard to take his eyes off Ellie , leans over and SHOUTS over the engine whine . MALCOLM : So you two dig up dinosaurs ? GRANT : Try to ! Malcolm laughs , finding this very amusing , which confuses Grant . Hammond turns around annoyed . HAMMOND : You 'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm ! He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality , especially for a mathematician ! MALCOLM : Chaotician , actually ! Chaotician ! Hammond SNORTS , not even bothering to cover his contempt for Malcolm . MALCOLM : John does n't subscribe to Chaos , particularly what it has to say about his little science project ! HAMMOND : Codswollop ! Ian , you 've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island ! MALCOLM : I certainly have ! Very clearly ! Because of the behavior of the system in phase space ! Hammond just waves him off . HAMMOND : Page 19/139 MALCOLM : ( poking at Hammond 's knee ) John , John . HAMMOND : ( pushing him away ) Do n't do that ! MALCOLM : Dr. Grant , Dr. Sattler -- you 've heard of Chaos Theory ? ELLIE : ( shaking her head ) No . MALCOLM : No ? Non-linear equations ? Strange attractions ? ( again , she shrugs ) Dr. Sattler , I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction ! Grant just rolls his eyes as Malcolm gives her an oily grin , but Ellie smiles , enjoying Grant 's jealousy . Hammond turns to Gennaro and gives him a dirty look . HAMMOND : I bring scientists -- you bring a rock star . Hammond looks out the windshield , and CLAPS his hands excitedly . HAMMOND : There it is ! Up ahead , the others see it . ISLA NUBLAR . It 's a smallish island , completely ringed by thick clouds that give it a lush , mysterious feel . The PILOT pulls up over a spot in the clouds and starts to descend , fast . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) Bad wind shears ! We have to drop pretty fast ! Hold on , this can be a little thrilling ! The helicopter drops like a stone . Outside the windows , they can see cliff walls racing by , uncomfortably close . They bounce like hell , hitting wind up and down drafts . Only Hammond still feels chatty . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) We 're planning an airstrip ! On pilings , extending out Page 20/139 into the ocean twelve thousand feet ! Like La Guardia , only a lot safer ! What do you think ? They do n't answer , just hold on . As they near the ground , a luminous white cloud cross appears below them , a landing pad shining through the Plexiglas bubble in the floor of the chopper . The cross grows rapidly larger as the chopper plummets , but a sudden updraft catches them and they bounce skyward for a moment then drop again , even faster if possible , before landing with a hard BUMP . 14A EXTHELICOPTER LANDING PADDAY The chopper plummets and finally lands . One of the workers opens the door and the group gets out . Hammond looks out , proudly . 15 EXTHILLTOPDAY Two large , open-top jeeps ROAR down the hilltop away from the landing cross as the helicopter engines WHINE back to life and the rotors start to spin again . ELLIE , GRANT , and MALCOLM hold on tight in the front jeep , HAMMOND and GENNARO are in the rear jeep . Both cars have DRIVERS . They pass through an enormous gate in a thirty foot high fence , which is closed behind them by two PARK ATTENDANTS . There are large electrical insulators on the fences , warning lights that strobe importantly and clear signs -- `` ELECTRIFIED FENCE ! 10,000 VOLTS ! '' IN THE REAR JEEP , Gennaro regards the fences critically . GENNARO : The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place ? HAMMOND : And the concrete moats , and the motion sensor tracking systems . Donald , dear boy , do try to relax and enjoy yourself . GENNARO : Let 's get something straight , John . This is not a weekend excursion , this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island . Your investors , whom I represent , are deeply concerned . Forty-eight hours from now , if they - ( gestures to Grant , Ellie , and Malcolm ) - -are n't convinced . I 'm not convinced . And I can shut you down John . HAMMOND : Page 21/139 Forty-eight hours from now , I 'll be accepting your apologies . Now get out of the way . So I can see them ! He shoves Gennaro aside , to get a clear view of Grant , Ellie , and Malcolm . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) I would n't miss this for the world . The jeeps wind their way along a mountain road . IN THE LEAD JEEP , Ellie stares off to the right , fascinated by the thick tropical plant life around them . She tilts her head , as if something 's wrong with this picture . She reaches out and grabs hold of a leafy branch as they drive by , TEARING it from the tree . IN THE REAR JEPP , Hammond watching Grant , signals to his Driver . HAMMOND : Just stop here , stop here . Slow , slow . He slows down , then stops . So does the front jeep . IN THE FRONT JEEP , Ellie stares at the leaf , amazed , running her hand lightly over it . ELLIE : Alan - But Grant 's not paying attention . He 's staring too , out the other side of the jeep . Grant notices that several of the tree trunks are leafless just as thick as the other trees , but gray and bare . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) ( still staring at the leaf ) This should n't be here . Grant twists in his seat as the jeep stops and looks at one of the gray tree trunks . Riveted , he slowly stands up in his seat , as if to get closer . He moves to the top of the seat , practically on his tiptoes . He raises his head , looking up the length of the trunk . He looks higher . And higher . And higher . That 's no tree trunk . That 's a leg . Grant 's jaw drops , his head falls all the way back , and he looks even higher , above the tree line . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) Page 22/139 ( still looking at the leaf ) This species of vermiform was been extinct since the cretaceous period . This thing - Grant , never tearing his eyes from the brachiosaur , reaches over and grabs Ellie 's head , turning it to face the animal . She sees it , and drops the leaf . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) Oh - - my - - God . Grant lets out a long , sharp , HAH - a combination laugh and shout of joy . He gets out of the jeep , and Ellie follows . Grant points to the thing and manages to put together his first words since its appearance : GRANT : THAT 'S A DINOSAUR ! - - a dinosaur . Chewing the branches . Technically , it 's a brachiosaur , of the sauropod family , but we 've always called it brontosaurus . It CRUCHES the branch in its mouth , which is some thirty-five feet up off the ground , at the end of its long , arching neck . It stares down at the people in the car with a pleasant , stupid gaze . Ellie looks up at the sauropods in wonder . They 've pretty light on their feet - a far cry from the sluggish , lumbering brutes we would have expected . Hammond gets out of his jeep and comes back to join them . He looks like a proud parent showing off the kid . Ian Malcolm looks at Hammond , amazed , and with an expression that is a mixture of admiration and rapprochement . MALCOLM : You did it . You crazy son of a bitch , you did it . Grant and Ellie continue walking , following the dinosaur . GRANT : The movement ! ELLIE : The - - agility . You 're right ! In their amazement , Grant and Ellie talk right over each other . GRANT : Ellie , we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness . It does n't apply , they 're totally wrong ! This is a warm-blooded creature . They 're totally wrong . Page 23/139 ELLIE : They were wrong . Case closed . in a swamp to support it 's body Several of the top branches are sauropod , reaching for a branch effortlessly on its hind legs . This thing does n't live weight for God 's sake ! suddenly RIPPED away . Another high above their heads , stands GRANT : ( to Hammond ) That thing 's got a what , twenty-five , twenty-seven foot neck ? HAMMOND : The brachiosaur ? Thirty . Grant and Ellie continue to walk . GRANT : - - and you 're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that ? ! Like that ! ? ( to Hammond ) This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness . HAMMOND : ( proudly ) We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour . ELLIE : You 've got a T-rex ! ? ( to Grant ) He 's got a T-rex ! A T-rex ! He said he's- - GRANT : Say again ? HAMMOND : Yes , we have a T-rex . Grant feels faint . He sits down on the ground . ELLIE : Honey , put your head between your knees , and breathe . Hammond walks in front of them and looks out . Page 24/139 HAMMOND : Dr. Grant , my dear Dr. Sattler . Welcome to Jurassic Park . They turn and look at the view again . It 's beautiful vista , reminiscent of an African plain . A whole herd of dinosaurs crosses the plain , maybe a hundred that we see in a quick glance alone . GRANT : Ellie , they 're absolutely - - they 're moving in herds . They do move in herds ! ELLIE : We were right ! GRANT : ( to Hammond ) How did you do it ? ! ( or ) How did you do this ? ! HAMMOND : I 'll show you . Finally , we notice Gennaro , who was sort of faded into the background while the others reacted . He 's just staring , a look of absolute rapture on his face . He speaks in a voice that is hushed and reverent . GENNARO : We are going to make a fortune with this place . 16 OMITTED 17 EXTMAIN COMPOUNDDAY The main of Jurassic Park is a large area with three main structures connected by walkways and surrounded by two impressive fences , the outer fence almost twenty feet high . Outside the fences , the jungle has been encouraged to grow naturally . The largest building is the visitor 's center , several stories tall , its walls still skeletal , unfinished . There 's a huge glass rotunda in the center . The second building looks like a private residence , a compound unto itself , with smoked windows and its own perimeter fence . The third structure is n't really a building at all , but the impressive cage we saw earlier , overgrown inside with thick jungle foliage . The jeeps pull up in front of the visitor 's center . Page 25/139 A18 EXTVISITOR 'S CENTERDAY HAMMOND leads GRANT , ELLIE , GENNARO , and MALCOLM up the stairs , talking as he goes , Two ladies open the doors to the Visitor Center . 18 INTVISITOR 'S CENTERDAY The lobby of the still-unfinished visitor 's center is a highceilinged place , and has to be house its central feature , a large skeleton of a tyrannosaur that is attacking bellowing sauropod . WORKMEN in the basket of a Condor crane are still assembling skeletons . A staircase climbs the far wall , to another wing . HAMMOND : ( continuing ) - - the most advanced amusement park in the world , combining all the latest technologies . I 'm not talking rides , you know . Everybody has rides . We made a living biological attractions so astonishing they 'll capture the imagination of the entire planet ! Grant stares up at the dinosaur skeletons and just shakes his head . Ellie catches his reaction . ELLIE : So what are you thinking ? GRANT : We 're out of a job . Ian Malcolm pops in between them MALCOLM : Do n't you mean `` extinct '' ? Ellie and Malcolm move on ahead . CUT TO : 19 INTSHOW ROOMDAY HAMMOND : Why do n't you all sit down . GRANT , ELLIE , and MALCOLM take their seats in the front row of the fifty seat auditorium . GENNARO sits behind them . HAMMOND walks over to the giant screen in front of them . Behind him , a huge image of himself beams down at him from the giant television screen . HAMMOND ( screen ) Hello , John ! HAMMOND ( stage ) Page 26/139 ( to the group ) Say hello ! ( then , fumbling with his three by five cards ) Oh , I 've got lines . He scans them , looking for his place . The screen Hammond continues without him , HAMMOND ( screen ) Fine , I guess ! But how did I get here ? ! HAMMOND ( stage ) Uh - ( finding his place ) '' Here , let me show you . First I 'll need a drop of blood . Your blood ! '' The screen-Hammond extends his finger and the stage-Hammond reaches out and mimes pocking it with a needle . HAMMOND ( screen ) Ouch , John ! That hurt ! HAMMOND ( stage ) '' Relax , John . It 's all part of the miracle of cloning ! '' While the two Hammonds rattle on , the screen image splits into two Hammonds , then four then eight , and so on , like a shampoo commercial . Grant , Ellie , and Malcolm huddle together excitedly in the audience . GRANT : Cloning from What ? ! Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand ! MALCOLM : Not without massive sequence gaps ! ELLIE : Paleo-DNA ? From what source ? Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood ? ! GENNARO : Shhhhh ! 20IN THE FILM , the screen-Hammond is joined by another figure , this one animated . MR. DNA is a cartoon character , a happy-go-lucky doublehelix strand of recombinant DNA . Mr. DNA jumps down onto the screenHammond 's head and slides down his nose . Page 27/139 HAMMOND : Well ! Mr. DNA ! Where 'd you come from ? MR. DNA From your blood ! Just one drop of your blood contains billions of strands of DNA , the building blocks of life ! 21 OMITTED 22IN THE FILM , Mr. DNA has taken over the show , and is speaking to the audience from the screen . MR. DNA A DNA strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing ! And sometimes animals that went extinct millions of years ago , like dinosaurs , left their blueprints behind for us to find ! We just had to know where to look ! The screen image changes from animated to a nature- photography look . It 's an extreme close-up of a mosquito , its fangs suck the deep into some animals flesh , its body pulsing and engorging with blood it's drinking . MR. DNA ( cont 'd ) A hundred million years ago , there were mosquitoes , just like today . And , just like today , they fed on the blood of animals . Even dinosaurs ! The camera races back to show the mosquito is perched on top of a giant animated brachiosaur . The image changes , to another close-up , this one of a tree branch , its bark glistening with golden sap . Mr. DNA leaps on the sap . MR. DNA ( cont 'd ) Sometimes , after biting a dinosaur , the mosquito would land on a branch of a tree , and get stuck in the sap ! The engorged mosquito lands in the tree sap , and gets stuck . So is Mr. DNA . He tugs his legs , but they stay stuck . MR. DNA WHOA ! Now the tree sap flows over them , covering up Mr. DNA and the mosquito completely . Mr. DNA SHOUTS from inside the tree sap . MR. DNA ( cont 'd ) After a long time , the tree sap would get hard and become fossilized , just like a dinosaur bone , preserving the mosquito inside ! 23A SCIENCE LABORATORY The place buzzes with activity . Everywhere , there are piles of amber , tagged and labeled with SCIENTISTS in white coats examining it under microscopes . Page 28/139 One SCIENTIST moves a complicated drill apparatus next to the chuck of amber with a fossilized mosquito inside and BORES into the side of it . MR. DNA escapes through the drill hole as the Scientist moves the amber onto a microscope and peers through the eyepiece . MR. DNA ( O.S . ) until Jurassic Park 's scientists came along ! 24THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE We see the greatly enlarged image of a mosquito through the lens . MR. DNA ( O.S . ) Using sophisticated techniques , they extract the preserved blood from the mosquito , and - A long needle is inserted through the amber , into the thorax of the mosquito , and makes an extraction . MR. DNA ( cont 'd ) - -Bingo ! Dino DNA ! Mr. DNA jumps down in front of DNA data as it races by at headache speed . He holds his head , dizzied by it . MR. DNA ( cont 'd ) A full DNA strand contains three billion genetic codes ! If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day , it 'd take two years to look at the entire strand ! It 's that long ! And since it 's so old , it 's full of holes ! That 's where our geneticists take over ! 25AINTGENETICS LABDAY SCIENTISTS toil in a lab with two huge white towers at either side . MR. DNA Thinking Machine supercomputers and gene sequencers break down the strand in minutes - One SCIENTIST , in the back has his arms encased in two long rubber tubes . He 's strapped into a bizarre apparatus , staring into a complex headpiece and moving his arms gently , like Tai Chi movements . MR. DNA ( cont 'd ) - - and Virtual Reality displays show our geneticists the gaps in the DNA sequence ! Since most animal DNA is ninety percent identical , we use the complete DNA of a frog - 25BON THE V.R . DISPLAY we see an actual DNA strand , except it has a big hole in the Page 29/139 center , where the vital information is missing . Mr. DNA bounds into the frame , carrying a butch of letters in one hand . He puts it in the gap and turns back against it , GRUNTING as he shoves into place . MR. DNA ( straining ) - - to fill in the - - holes and - -complete - - the - ( finally getting it ) - - code ! Whew ! He brushes his hands off , satisfied . MR. DNA ( cont 'd ) Now we can make a baby dinosaur ! 26IN THE AUDIENCE The scientist look at each other , not sure . HAMMOND : All this has some dramatic music - - da dum da dum da dum dum - - march or something , it 's not written yet , and the tour moves on - He throws a switch and safety bars appear out of nowhere and drop over their seats , CLICKING into place . HAMMOND : For your own safety ! The row of seats moves out of the auditorium . 27INTHALLWAYDAY The row of seats moves slowly past a row of double-panned glass window beneath a large sign that reads '' GENETICS/FERTILIZATION/HATCHERY . '' Inside , TECHNICIANS work at microscopes . In the back is a section entirely lit by blue ultraviolet light . Mr. DNA VOICE continues over a speaker in each seat . MR. DNA ( O.S . ) Our fertilization department is where the dinosaur DNA takes the place of the DNA in unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs - - and then it 's on to the nursery , where we welcome the dinosaurs back into the world ! GENNARO has a wondrous grin plastered on his face , just loving everything now . GENNARO : This is overwhelming , John . ( people ) animatronics ? Are these characters Page 30/139 HAMMOND : No , we do n't have any animatronics here . These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park . GRANT , ELLIE , and MALCOLM are frustrated , leaning forward , straining against the safety bars for a better look . But the cars keep going . GRANT : Wait a minute ! mitosis ? ! ? How do you interrupt the cellular ELLIE : Ca n't we see the unfertilized host eggs ? ! But the cars are already moving on to another set of windows , which give a glimpse into what looks like a control room . HAMMOND : Shortly , shortly .... MR. DNA ( O.S . ) Our control room contains some of the most sophisticated automation ever attempted in - Grant strains to look back into the labs , but the cars move past again , no intention of slowing down . GRANT : Ca n't you stop these things ? ! HAMMOND : Sorry ! It 's kind of a ride ! GRANT : ( to Malcolm ) Let 's get outta here ! The two of them team up on the safety bars . Grant shoves his all the way back with one foot and Malcolm does the same . They stand up and head for the door of the hatchery . GENNARO : Hey ! You ca n't do that ! Too late . Ellie slips out from under her safety bar too and stomps right across Gennaro 's seat . GENNARO : Page 31/139 Can they do that ? They reach the door to the hatchery . Grant tries to shove it open , but just THUDS into it . He rattles the handle , but the door wo n't budge as it 's on a security key-card system . HAMMOND steps up and takes his glasses off . HAMMOND : Relax , Donald , relax . They 're scientists , They ought to be curious . ( he steps up to the code box ) It 's a retinal scanner . He pushes various code numbers . The door opens . He steps aside , and the group eagerly goes up the stairs . 28INT.HALLWAY/STAIRS-DAY GRANT runs up the stairs . MALCOLM and ELLIE eagerly try to get a look at the lab . HAMMOND and GENNARO come up and join Grant at the door . GENNARO : John , we - - what I 'm just saying .... HAMMOND : Relax Donald , relax . They 're scientists . They ought to be curious . Hammond reaches the door , Grant tries to pry it open . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) Dr. Grant , just a minute , just a minute , ( or ) Dr. Grant , just a moment , dear boy . ( he pushes the code ; the door opens ) Remember what Samuel Johnson said . ( they step into the cubicle ) '' Curiosity is one of the permanent and certain characteristics of a vigorous intellect ! '' ( the second door opens ) Right ! Come along . INTHATCHERY/NURSERYDAY The hatchery is a vast , open room , bathed in infrared light . Long tables run the length of the place , all covered with eggs , their pale outlines obscured by hissing low mist that 's all through the room . HAMMOND : Come on in . HAMMOND takes off his hat and hands it one of the technicians . Page 32/139 HENRY WU , late twenties , Asian-American , wearing a white lab coat works at a nearby table , making notes . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) Good day , Henry . WU : Oh , good day , Sir . GRANT goes to a round , open with various eggs under a strong light . One of the eggs makes strong movements - a robotic arm steadies the shell . GRANT : My God ! Look ! Hammond , Ellie , and Malcolm join him , as does Henry Wu . WU : Ah , perfect timing ! to go to the boat . I 'd hoped they 'd hatch before I had HAMMOND : Henry , why did n't you tell me ? you know I insist on being here when they 're born . Hammond puts on a pair of plastic gloves . The egg begins to crack . The robotic arm moves away .... a BABY DINOSAUR tries to get out , just its head sticking out of the shell . Hammond reaches down and carefully breaks away egg fragments , helping the baby dinosaur out of its shell . HAMMOND : Come on , then , out you come . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) They imprint on the first living creature they come in contact with . That helps them to trust me . I 've been present for the birth of every animal on this Island . Just look at that . MALCOLM : Surely not the ones that have bred in the wild ? WU : Actually , they ca n't breed in the wild . Population control is one of our security precautions here . There is no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park . Page 33/139 Grant and Ellie exchange a look . She manages not to smile . MALCOLM : How do you know they ca n't breed ? WU : Because all the animals in Jurassic Park are females . ( I 've ) We engineered them that way . Hammond keeps his attention trained on the new dinosaur . HAMMOND : There you are . Out you come . ELLIE : Oh my God . HAMMOND : Could I have a tissue please ? WU : Right away ( certainly ) . Coming right up . The animal is now free , Hammond sets in don carefully next to its shell . Grant picks it up and holds it in the palm of his hand , under the incubator 's heat light . GRANT : Blood temperature feels like high eighties . HAMMOND : Wu ? WU : Ninety-one . Grant picks up the large , broken half-shell , but the robotic arm snatches it back out of his hand , and puts it down . GRANT : Homoeothermic ? It holds that temperature ? ( to Wu ) Incredible . Malcolm is looking at Hammond , skeptical . MALCOLM : But again , how do you know they 're all female ? Page 34/139 Does someone go into the park and , uh dinosaurs ' skirts ? - - lift up the WU : We control their chromosomes . It 's not that difficult . All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway . It takes an extra hormone at the right developmental stage to create a male , and we simply deny them that . HAMMOND : Your silence intrigues me . MALCOLM : John , the kind of control you 're attempting is not possible . If there 's one thing the history of evolution has taught us , it 's that life will not be contained . Life breaks free . It expands to new territories . It crashes through barriers . Painfully , maybe even .. dangerously , but and ... well , there it is . Ellie listens to him , impressed . HAMMOND : Watch her head - support her head . Grant , ignoring the others , picks up the baby dinosaur , and holds it on the palm of his hand , under the incubator 's heat light . He spreads the tiny animal out on the back of his hand and delicately runs his finger over its tail , counting the vertebrae . A look of puzzled recognition crosses his face . WU : You 're implying that a group of composed entirely of females will breed ? MALCOLM : I 'm simply saying that life - - finds a way . ELLIE : '' You ca n't control anything . '' I agree with that . I like that . She walks over to Malcolm , he smiles at her , too warmly . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) You can talk . I do n't k now how to say it . You 're just articulate . You say everything that I think , that I feel . It 's exciting . Page 35/139 ( or ) I find it so exciting . It 's exciting that you can't control life , that you know - ( or ) You know that , I find it terrifying . Life will always find a way . MALCOLM : That 's right . Will break through . ELLIE : I get ah - MALCOLM : I know , it 's very exciting . ELLIE : And scary . MALCOLM : And scary . ELLIE : When people try to control things that it 's out of their power - MALCOLM : It 's anti-nature . ELLIE : Anti-nature . Grant does n't notice , as he 's still obsessed with the infant dinosaur , measuring and weighing it on a nearby lab bench . He stops , a strange look on his face . He knows what this animal is - - but it ca n't be . GRANT : ( dreading the answer ) What species is this ? WU : Uh - - it 's a Velociraptor . Grant and Ellie turn slowly and look at each other , then look at Hammond , astonished . Page 36/139 GRANT : You bred raptors ? 29EXT.RAPTOR PEN-DAY Grant charges across the compound , a fire in his eyes , ahead of ELLIE , MALCOLM , and GENNARO . HAMMOND struggles to keep up . HAMMOND : Dr. Grant , Dr. Grant ? Uh - -we planned to show you the raptors later , after lunch . But Grant has stopped abruptly next to the Velociraptor pen , which we recognize as the heavily fortified cage we some earlier , which the San Quentin towers at one end . Grant stands right up against the fence , eyes wide , dying for a glimpse . HAMMOND catches up , slightly out of breath . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) Dr. Grant - - as I was saying , we 've laid out lunch for you before you head out into the park . Alejandro , our gourmet chef - GRANT : What are they doing ? As they watch , a giant crane lowers something large down into the middle of the jungle foliage inside the pen . Something very large . It 's a steer . They poor thing looks disconcerted as hell , helpless its in a harness , flailing its legs in the air . HAMMOND : Feeding them . ( moving along ) Alejandro is preparing a delightful meal for us . A Chilean sea bass , I believe . Shall we ? Grant goes up to the viewing deck . The others follow , staring as the steer disappears into the shroud of foliage . The line from the crane hangs for a moment . The jungle seems to grow very quiet . They all stare at the motionless crane line . It jerks suddenly , like a fishing pole finally getting a nibble . There 's a pause - - - and then a frenzy . The line jerks every which way , the jungle plants sway and SNAP from some frantic activity within , there is a cacophony of GROWLING , of SNAPPING , of wet CRUNCHES that mean the steer is literally being torn to pieces and is almost makes it worse that we ca n't see anything of what 's going on - - Page 37/139 - - and then it 's quiet again . The line jerks a few times , then stops . Slowly the SOUND of the jungle starts up again . HAMMOND : Fascinating animals , fascinating . ELLIE : Oh my God . HAMMOND : Give time , they 'll out draw the T-rex . Guarantee it . GRANT : I want to see them . Can we get closer ? Ellie puts a hand on his arm , like calming an overexcited child . ELLIE : Alan , these are n't bones anymore . HAMMOND : We 're - - still perfecting a viewing system . The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting . A VOICE comes from behind them . VOICE ( O.S . ) They should all be destroyed . They turn and look at the man who spoke . ROBERT MULDOON , the grim-faced man who was present at the accident in the beginning , is fortyish , British . He joins them and takes his hat off . When Muldoon talks , you listen . HAMMOND : Robert . Robert Muldoon , my game warden from Kenya . of an alarmist , I 'm afraid , But he 's dealt with the raptors more than anyone . GRANT : ( introducing himself ) Alan Grant . Tell me , what kind of metabolism do they have ? What 's their growth rate ? ( or ) rate of growth . Bit Page 38/139 MULDOON : They 're lethal at eight months . And I do lethal . I've hunted most things that can hunt you , but the way these things move - GRANT : Fast for biped ? MULDOON : Cheetah speed . Fifty , sixty miles per hour if they ever got out in the open . And they 're astonishing jumpers . HAMMOND : Yes , yes , yes , which is why we take extreme precautions . They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - GRANT : Do they show intelligence ? theirs we assumed - - With the brain cavity like MULDOON : They show extreme intelligence , even problem solving . Especially the big one . We bred eight originally , but when she came in , she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others . That one - -when she looks at you , you can see she 's thinking ( or ) working things out . She 's the reason we have to feed 'em like this . She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came . ELLIE : The fences are electrified , right ? MULDOON : That 's right . But they never attack the same place twice . They were testing the fences for weaknesses . Systematically . They remembered . Behind them , the crane WHIRRS back to life , raising the cable back up out of the raptor pen . The guest turn and stare as the end portion of the cable becomes visible . The steer has been dragged completely away , leaving only the tattered , bloody harness . Hammond claps his hands together excitedly . Page 39/139 HAMMOND : Who 's hungry ? After you , my dear . 30INT.VISITOR CENTER PRESENTATION ROOM - DAY HAMMOND , GRANT , ELLIE , MALCOLM , and GANNARO eat lunch at a long table in the visitor 's center restaurant . There is a large buffet table and two WAITERS to serve them . The room is darkened and Hammond is showing slides of various scenes all around them . Hammond 's own recorded voice describes current and future features of the park while the slides flash artists' renderings of all them . The real Hammond turns and speaks over the narration . HAMMOND : None of these attractions have been finished yet . The park will open with the basic tour you 're about to take , and then other rides will come on line after six or twelve months . Absolutely spectacular designs . Spared no expense . More slides CLICK past , a series of graphs dealing with profits , attendance and other fiscal projections . Donald Gennaro , who has become increasingly friendly with Hammond , even giddy , grins from ear to ear . GENNARO : And we can charge anything we want ! Two thousand a day , ten thousand a day - - people will pay it ! And then there 's the merchandising - HAMMOND : Donald , this park was not built to carter only to the super rich . Everyone in the world 's got a right to enjoy these animals . GENNARO : Sure , they will , they will . ( laughing ) We 'll have a - - coupon day or something . Grant looks down , at the plate he 's eating from . It 's in the shape of the island itself . He looks at his drinking cup . It 's got a T-rex on it , and a splashy Jurassic Park logo . There are a stack of folded amusement park-style maps on the table in front of Grant . He picks one up . Boldly , across the top it says , `` Fly United to Jurassic Park ! '' Page 40/139 HAMMOND : ( on tape ) - - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - HAMMOND : ( to Gennaro ) That 's conservative , of course . speculate wildly . There 's no reason to GENNARO : I 've never been a rich man . I hear it 's nice . Is it nice ? Ian Malcolm , who was been watching the screens with outright contempt , SNORTS , as if he 's finally had enough . MALCOLM : The lack of humility before nature that 's been displayed here staggers me . They all turn and look at him . GENNARO : Thank you , Dr. Malcolm , but I think things are a little different than you and I feared . MALCOLM : Yes , I know . They 're a lot worse . GENNARO : Now , wait a second , we have n't even see the park yet . Let 's just hold out concerns until - ( or alt . version ) Wait - we were invited to this island to evaluate the safety conditions of the park , physical containment . The theories that all simple systems have complex behavior , that animals in a zoo environment will eventually begin to behave in an unpredictable fashion have nothing to do with that evaluation . This is not some existential furlough , this is an on-site inspection . You are a doctor . Do your job . You are invalidating your own assessment . I 'm sorry , John - HAMMOND : Alright Donald , alright , but just let him talk . Page 41/139 I want to hear all viewpoints . ( or ) I truly am . I truly do . MALCOLM : Do n't you see the danger , John , inherent in what you're doing here ? Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet . But you wield it like a kid who 's found his dad 's gun . MALCOLMGENNARO : If I may .... It is hardly appropriate to start hurling Excuse me , excuse me - -generalizations before - I 'll tell you . MALCOLM ( cont 'd ) The problem with scientific power you 've used is it did n't require any discipline to attain it . You read what others had done and you took the next step . You did n't earn the knowledge yourselves , so you do n't take the responsibility for it . You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could , and before you knew what you had , you patented it , packages it , slapped in on a plastic lunch box , and now you want to sell it . HAMMOND : You do n't give us our due credit . Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before . MALCOLM : Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they did n't stop to think if they should . Science can create pesticides , but it can't tell us not to use them . Science can make a nuclear reactor , but it ca n't tell us not to build it ! HAMMOND : But this is nature ! Why not give an extinct species a second chance ? ! I mean , Condors . Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I 'd created a flock of them on the island , you would n't be saying any of this ! ( or ) have anything to say at all ! Page 42/139 MALCOLM : Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam . Dinosaurs had their shot . Nature selected them for extinction . HAMMOND : I do n't understand this Luddite attitude , especially from a scientist . How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act ? MALCOLM : There 's nothing that great about discovery . ( or ) What 's so great about discovery ? It 's a violent , penetrative act that scars what it explores . What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world ! GENNARO : Please - - let 's hear something from the others . Grant ? I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler ? Dr. ELLIE : The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem , and therefore , how could you assume you can control it ? You have plants right here in this building , for example , that are poisonous . You picked them because they look pretty , but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves . Violently , if necessary . Exasperated , Hammond turns to Grant , who looks shell-shocked . HAMMOND : Dr. Grant , if there 's one person who can appreciate all of this - ( or ) What am I trying to do ? But Grant speaks quietly , really thrown by all of this . GRANT : I feel - - elated and - - frightened and - ( starts over ) The world has just changed so radically . We 're all Page 43/139 running to catch up . I do n't want to jump to any conclusions , but look - He leans forward , a look of true concern on his face . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Dinosaurs and man - - two species separated by 65 million years of evolution - - have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together . How can we have the faintest idea of what to expect ? HAMMOND : I do n't believe it . I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I 've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer ! ? GENNARO : Thank you . One of the WAITERS whispers to Hammond . HAMMOND : Ah - - they 're here . GRANT : Who ? A31INTVISITOR 'S CENTER LOBBY - DAY HAMMOND , GRANT , ELLIE , MALCOLM , and GENNARO walks out of the restaurant and into the lobby of the visitor 's center . They head down the stairs , and pass the skeletons of the dinosaurs again . HAMMOND : You four are going to have a little company out in the park . Spend a little time with our target audience . Maybe they 'll help you get the spirit of this place . GRANT : What does he mean by `` target audience '' ? Hammond turns toward the door of the center and throws his arms out expansively . HAMMOND : ( bellowing ) KIDS ! ! Two kids standing in the doorway to the center break into a broad smiles . TIM , the boy , is about nine years old ; ALEXIX , his sister , looks around twelve . Page 44/139 TIM & LEX Grandpa ! They race across the lobby and into Hammond 's arms , knocking him over on the steps . LEX : We miss you . TIM : Thanks for the presents . LEX : We love the presents . HAMMOND : You must be careful with me . helicopter ? Did you like the TIM : It was great ! It drops , we were dropping ! Grant looks on . 31EXTVISITOR 'S CENTERDAY Two modified Ford Explorers leap up out of an underground garage beneath the visitor 's center . They move quietly , with a faint electronic HUM , and straddle a partially buried metal rail is the middle of the road . They pull to a stop where the group is gathered . Ellie is off to the side with ALEXIS , introducing herself warmly . HAMMOND is with MALCOLM , GRANT , and GENNARO . HAMMOND : Have a heart gentlemen . Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion . GENNARO : Hey ! Where are the brakes ? HAMMOND : Brakes ? No . No brakes . They 're electric cars , guided by this track in the roadway , and totally non-polluting , top of the line ! LEX : It 's interactive CD-ROM . Look , see - - you just touch Page 45/139 the right part of the screen and it talks about whatever you want . HAMMOND : Spared no expense . Have fun . I 'll be watching you from the control ( or ) back in control . ( to Ellie ) Come along , my dear . You 'll ride in the second car , I can promise you you 'll have a real wonderful time . ELLIE : Oh thank you so much . So you 'll see you later then . Hammond turns and head back towards the Visitor 's Center . MALCOLM : ( too eagerly ; to Grant ) I 'll ride with Dr. Sattler . ( or ) I 'm going to ride with Dr. Sattler . He turns and walks over to Ellie . Grant frowns , not liking this one bit . He moves to follow , but TIM cuts him off , and stares up at him , wide-eyed TIM : I read your book . GRANT : Oh , yeah - - great . Grant heads for the rear car . Tim follows . TIM : You really think dinosaurs turned into birds ? And that 's where all the dinosaurs went ? Grant opens the door of the rear car and climbs in . follows . GRANT : Well , uh , a few species - - may have evolved , uh - along those lines - - yeah . A mechanical voice intones from inside : VOICE : '' Two to four passengers to a car , please . Children under ten must be accompanied by an adult . '' Page 46/139 Tim Tim is right behind Grant , so Grant keeps moving , across the back seat of the car and out the other door . But Tim follows . TIM : Because they sure do n't look like birds to me . I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - GRANT : Listen , ahh - TIM : Tim . GRANT : Tim . Which car were you planning on - TIM : Whichever one you are . Grant goes to the front car again , opens the rear door , and holds it for Tim , who climbs in the back seat , rattling on and on . TIM : Then I head about this thing in OMNI ? About the meteor making all this heat that made a bunch of diamond dust ? And that changed the weather and they died because of the weather ? Then my teacher told me about this other book by a guy named Bakker ? And he said the dinosaurs died of a bunch of diseases . SLAM ! Grant closes the car door on Tim . He turns and head for the rear vehicle - - - and bumps right into Lex . LEX : ( points at Ellie ) She said I should ride with you because it would be good for you . Grant looks over at Ellie , annoyed . GRANT : She 's a deeply neurotic woman . CUT TO : 32INTCONTROL ROOMDAY Page 47/139 The Jurassic Park control room looks like a mission control for a space launch , with several computer terminals and dozens of video screens that display images of various dinosaurs , taken from all over the park . There 's a large glass map of the island at the front of the room that is lit up like a Christmas tree with various colored lights , each one with a number and identification code next to it . But the place is unfinished , with unattached cables , construction materials , and ladders scattered about . The mood among the half dozen TECHNICIANS present is chaotic as they rush around with last-minute adjustments . MULDOON whisks in through the double doors . HAMMOND is right behind him . They go straight to the main console , where RAY ARNOLD fortyish , a chronic worrier and chain-smoker , is seated . MULDOON : National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm about seventy-five miles west of us . Hammond sighs and looks over Arnold 's shoulder . HAMMOND : Why did n't I build in Orlando ? MULDOON : I 'll keep an eye on it . the last one . Maybe it 'll swing south like HAMMOND : ( a deep breath ) Ray , start the tour program . He punches a button on the console . ARNOLD ( cont 'd ) ( not exactly comforting ) Hold onto your butts . CUT TO : 33EXTVISITOR 'S CENTERDAY With a loud CHUNK , the Explorers start forward along the electrical pathway . GENNARO , TIM , and LEX are in the front vehicle ; GRANT , ELLIE , and MALCOLM in the rear . 33AEXTMAIN GATESDAY They pass through two enormous , primitive gates , torches blazing on either side . Page 48/139 34EXTJURASSIC PARK DAY IN THE REAR CAR , the Explorer 's speakers BLARE with fanfare of trumpets , and the interior video screen flashes `` Welcome to Jurassic Park . '' A familiar VOICE comes over the speaker : VOICE ( O.S . ) Welcome to Jurassic Park . You are now entering the lost world of the prehistoric past , a world - VOICE ( cont 'd ) creatures long gone from the face of the earth , which you are privileged to see for the first time . INTCONTROL ROOM : HAMMOND watches the monitor . themselves . His grandchildren are enjoying HAMMOND : By the way , that 's James Earl Jones ( or ) Richard Kiley . We spared no expense ! IN THE PARK , the fences are retaining walls are covered with greenery and growth , to heighten the illusion of moving through a jungle . IN THE FRONT CAR GENNARO : The accident took place in a restricted area . It would not have been available to the public access . So how can the safety of the public be called into question ? The cars come to the top of a low rise , where a break in the foliage gives them a view down a sloping field that is broken by a river . The tour voice continues . VOICE ( O.S . ) To the right , you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs on our tour , called Dilophosaurus . IN THE FRONT CAR , Tim and Lex practically SLAM up against the windows , to get a look . GENNARO : ( keeps talking ) The safety . That 's the problem I had to answer . LEX : Shhh . TIM : Page 49/139 I ca n't see . GENNARO : What are we looking for ? TIM : Dilophosaurus . IN THE REAR CAR : Grant looks at his map . Ellie , hearing the voice , reacts . ELLIE : Oh , shit . GRANT : Dilophosaurus . Grant , Malcolm , and Ellie press against the windows . DOWN NEAR THE RIVER BANK there are a lot of beautiful plants , but no sign of a herd of anything . The tour voice continues anyway . VOICE ( O.S . ) One of the earliest carnivores , we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous , spitting its venom at its prey , causing blindness and eventually paralysis , allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure . This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful , but deadly addition to Jurassic Park . Corny SCARY MUSIC plays over the speaker . IN THE FRONT CAR , TIM : There 's nothing there ! IN THE REAR CAR , ELLIE : Alan , where ? Grant and the others sit back , disappointed . GRANT : Damn . ON THE ROAD , the cars move on . As they roll past , we notice the headlights are on , even in the daytime . Page 50/139 CUT TO : 35INTCONTROL ROOM DAY RAY ARNOLD watches his computer screen and the video monitors at the same time , keeping an eye on the cars as they move through the park . HAMMOND hovers over his shoulder . ARNOLD : Vehicle headlights are on and do n't respond . Those should n't be running off the car batteries . He signs and reaches for a clipboard hanging next to his chair and jots this down . ARNOLD ( cont 'd ) Item one fifty-one on today 's glitch list . We 've got all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo , and the computer 's not even on its feet yet . Hammond shakes his head and turns to the TECHNICIAN to his right , who still has his back to them , watching a Costa Rican game show on one of his monitors and drinking a Jolt cola . HAMMOND : Dennis , our lives are in your hands and you have butterfingers . The Technician turns around his chair and extends his arms in a Christ-like pose . As we get a good look at him , we get the sinking feeling that we 've seen him somewhere before . And we have . DENNIS NEDRY is the man who accepted a suitcase full of cash in San Jose . NEDRY : I am totally unappreciated in my time . We can run the whole park from this room , with minimal staff , for up to three days . You think that kind of automation is easy ? Or cheap ? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job ? Because I 'd sure as hell like to see them try . HAMMOND : I 'm sorry about your financial problems . But they are your problems . I really am . NEDRY : You 're right , John . You 're absolutely right . Everything 's my problem . Page 51/139 HAMMOND : I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you , Dennis . I really will not . NEDRY : I do n't think there 's been any debate . debate ... my mistakes .... There 's no HAMMOND : I do n't blame people for their mistakes , but I do ask that they pay for them . NEDRY : Thanks , Dad . ARNOLD : Dennis - -the headlights . NEDRY : I 'll de-bug the tour program when they get back . Okay ? It 'll eat a lot of computer cycles ; parts of the system may go down for a while - - Do n't blame me . If I am playing ... losing memory .... MULDOON , who has been hovering near the video monitors as always , turns towards them , annoyed . MULDOON : Quiet , all if you . paddock . They 're coming to the tyrannosaur CUT TO : 36EXTTYRANNOSAUR PADDOCKDAY The two Explorers drive along a high ridge and stop at the edge of the large , open plain that is separated from the road by a fifteenfoot fence , clearly marked with `` DANGER ! '' signs and ominous-looking electrical post . TIM , LEX , and GENNARO are pressed forward against the windows , eyes wide , waiting for you-know-who . IN THE REAR CAR , The voice of the radio drones on , but GRANT , ELLIE , and MALCOLM are n't even listening anymore , dying of anticipation . VOICE ( O.S . ) The mighty tyrannosaurus arose late in the dinosaur history . Dinosaurs ruled the earth for hundred and Page 52/139 fifty million years , but it was n't until the last- GRANT : Will you turn that thing off ? Ellie flips a switch and they wait in silence - - except for Malcolm , who looks at the ceiling , thinking aloud . MALCOLM : God creates dinosaurs . God destroys dinosaurs . God creates man . Man destroys God . Man creates dinosaurs . ELLIE : ( finishing it for him ) Dinosaur eats man . Woman inherits the Earth . ARNOLD ( O.S . ) Hold on , we 'll try to tempt the rex . IN THE PADDOCK , there is a low HUMMING sound . Out in the middle of the field , a small cage rises up into view , lifted on hydraulics from underground . The cage bars slide down , leaving the cage 's occupant standing alone in the middle of the field . It 's a goat , one leg chained to a stake . It looks around , confused , and BLEATS plaintively . IN THE FRONT CAR , LEX and TIM look at the goat with widely different reactions . LEX : What 's going to happen to the goat ? the goat ? ! He 's going to eat TIM : ( in heaven ) Excellent . GENNARO : ( to Lex ) What 's the matter , kid , you never had lamb chops ? LEX : I happen to be a vegetarian . IN THE REAR CAR , GRANT : ( shakes his head ) Page 53/139 T-rex does n't want to be fed ; he wants to hunt . You ca n't just suppress sixty-five million years of gut instinct . IN THE PADDOCK : The goat waits . And waits . From the Explorers , six faces watch it expectantly . The goat tugs on its chain . It walks back and forth , nervous . It BLEATS . IN THE REAR CAR , Grant watches , his eyes glued , his breathing becoming a little more rapid . IN THE FRONT CAR , Tim and Lex ca n't tear their eyes away , IN THE PADDOCK , finally , the goat - - - lays down . IN THE REAR CAR , everyone sits back , disappointed again , as the cars pull forward to continue the tour . Malcolm picks up the microphone . MALCOLM : Now , eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour , right ? 37INTCONTROL ROOMDAY HAMMOND just shakes his head as Malcolm 's voice comes through , HAMMOND : I really hate that man . 38EXTPARKDAY GRANT gets into the seat , leaving MALCOLM behind ELLIE . He longingly looks out of the opposite window , while Malcolm rattles on to Ellie . MALCOLM : You see ? The tyrannosaur does n't obey set patterns or park schedules . It 's the essence of Chaos . ELLIE : I 'm still not clear on Chaos . MALCOLM : It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems . It 's only principle is the Butterfly Effect . A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Page 54/139 Park you get rain instead of sunshine . Ellie gestures with her hand to show this information has gone right over her head . MALCOLM : I made a fly by , I go too fast . Looking out of the opposite window , Grant sees movement at the far end of a field . He sits bolt upright , trying to get a better look . Malcolm , looking for another example - MALCOLM ( cont 'd ) ( points to the glass of water ) Here . Give me your glass of water . He dips his hand into the glass of water . He takes Ellie 's hand in his own . MALCOLM ( cont 'd ) Make like hieroglyphics . Now watch the way the drop of water falls on your hand . He flicks his fingers and a drop falls on the back of Ellie's hand . MALCOLM ( cont 'd ) Ready ? Freeze your hand . Now I 'm going to do the same thing from the exact same place . Which way is the drop going to roll off ? ( or ) Which way will the drop roll ? Over which finger ? Or down your thumb ? Or to the other side ? ELLIE : Uh - - thumb ! ( or ) The same way . MALCOLM : It changed . Why ? ( or ) Okay , back over your wrist . ( then ) Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - the orientations of the hairs - ELLIE : Alan , listen to this . MALCOLM : Page 55/139 - - on your hand , the amount of blood distending in your vessels , imperfections in the skin - ELLIE : Oh , imperfections ? MALCOLM : Microscopic - - never repeat , and vastly affect the outcome . That 's what ? ELLIE : Unpredictability .... MALCOLM : And even if we have n't seen it yet , I 'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now . There 's definitely something out in that field , and Grant has to see it . He jerks on the door handle and opens his door a few inches . He looks outside towards freedom , then looks around to is anybody's watching him . Malcolm lowers his voice , becoming more seductive now . MALCOLM ( cont 'd ) Life 's a lot like that , is n't it ? You meet someone by chance you 'll never meet again , and the course of your whole future changes . It 's dynamic - - its exciting - I think . Grant throws the door open and bolts out of the moving car . MALCOLM ( cont 'd ) There , there see ? ! I 'm right again ! ELLIE : Alan ? MALCOLM : No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle ! ELLIE : Alan ? She jumps out too and follows him into the field . MALCOLM : There 's another example ! Page 56/139 IN THE FRONT CAR , TIM : Hey ! I want to go with them ! IN THE REAR CAR , MALCOLM : See ? Here I am now , by myself , talking to myself - that 's Chaos Theory ! What the hell am I doing here ? I 'm the only one who knows what 's going on , etc , etc .... 39INTCONTROL ROOMDAY HAMMOND , MULDOON , and ARNOLD stare at the video monitor incredulously as everyone now pouts out of the cars and follows Grant down the hill . The cars roll on slowly , empty , their doors hanging open . ARNOLD : Uh - - Mr. Hammond - HAMMOND : Stop the program ! Stop the program ! MULDOON : There you are ! How many times did I tell you we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors ! ACROSS THE ROOM : DENNIS NEDRY sneaks a peek at the video monitor . It shows an image of the steel door , plainly marked - - `` EMBRYONIC COLD STORAGE . RESTRICTED ! '' He looks to another monitor , which is labeled `` EAST DOCK . '' The monitor shows a supply ship , moored at the dock . Its cargo is being uploaded and a large group of WORKERS is filing aboard . Nedry has something in the counter , where no one can see it . It 's a can of shaving cream . 40EXTPARKDAY GRANT , ELLIE , GENNARO , and the KIDS are out in the open field , heading towards a small stand of trees . For the first time , we notice the sky is darken rather early in the day . Tim dogs Grant 's footsteps , so excited he can hardly keep his feet on the ground . TIM : So like I was saying , there 's this other book by a guy named Bakker ? And he said dinosaurs died of a bunch of Page 57/139 diseases ? He definitely did n't say they turned into birds . Gennaro is scared as hell , following the others , but his head darting left and right . ELLIE : Alan ? Where are we going ? You see something ? GENNARO : Uh - - anybody else think we should n't be out here ? TIM : And his book was a lot fatter than yours . GRANT : Really ? ELLIE : Yours was fully illustrated , honey . GENNARO : Anybody at all . Feel free to speak up . Lex stumbles and Grant takes her hand , to stop her from falling . She looks up at him and smiles . Grant smiles back and tries to recover his hand , but Lex holds tight . He 's massively uncomfortable . Ellie notices . Suddenly they all stop in their tracks . A huge smile spreads across the faces of both Tim and Grant . Grant walks forward . Tim follows . ELLIE : Timmy , Timmy . LEX : Come back here , blanket head . Fearless , Tim walks forward behind Grant . HARDING ( O.S . ) Hi everybody , Do n't be scared . Tim reaches the clearing and sees : A Triceratops , a big one , lying on its side , blocking the light at the end of the path . It has an enormous curved shell that flanks its head , two big horns over its eyes , and a third on the end of its nose . It does n't move , just breathes , loud and raspy , blowing up a little clouds of dust with every exhalation . Page 58/139 Grant stands next to Harding , almost in a daze . GRANT : Beautiful . Is it okay ? Can I touch it ? HARDING : Sure . Grant walks next to the animal and strokes its head . moves forward to the animal . GRANT : Oh Ellie . It 's so beautiful . thing I ever saw . Ellie It 's the most beautiful ELLIE : It 's my favorite . They both kneel , checking the animal . He furrows his bow , noticing something , all professional curiosity now . The animal 's tongue , dark purple , droops limply from its mouth . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Ellie , take a look at this . ELLIE : Yeah , baby girl , it 's okay . She scratches the tongue with her fingernail . leaks from the broken blisters . A clear liquid ELLIE : Micro vesicles . That 's interesting . Grant , fascinated , wanders all the way around to the back of the animal . Harding joins Ellie and hands her his penlight . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) What are her symptoms ? HARDING : Imbalance , disorientation , labored breathing . happen about every six weeks or so . Seems to ELLIE : Six weeks ? She takes the penlight from the veterinarian and shines it in the animal 's eyes . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) Page 59/139 Are there pupillary effects from the tranquilizer ? HARDING : Yes , mitotic , pupils should be constricted . ELLIE : These are dilated . Take a look . HARDING : They are ? ( checks it out ) I 'll be damned . ELLIE : That 's pharmacological . From local plant life . She turns and studies the surrounding landscape . Her mind's really at work , puzzling over each piece of foliage . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) ( pointing ) Is that ( or ) this West Indian lilac ? HARDING : Yes . We know they 're toxic , but the animals do n't eat them . ELLIE : Are you sure ? HARDING : Pretty sure . ELLIE : There 's only one way to be positive . I need to see some droppings . ( or ) I have to see the dinosaur 's droppings . HARDING : You wo n't be able to miss them . ( or ) Ca n't miss them . Malcolm walks up to Ellie . MALCOLM : Page 60/139 Dino droppings ? ELLIE : Yeah . She walks way , Malcolm looks on . 41AINTCONTROL ROOMDAY HAMMOND and ARNOLD are watching the video monitors , displeased about something . Arnold is looking at one that gives them a view from the beach , looking out at the ocean . The clouds beyond are almost black with a tropical storm . ARNOLD : That storm center has n't dissipated or changed course . We 're going to have to cut the tour short , I 'm afraid . Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off . HAMMOND : You 're sure we have to ? ARNOLD : It 's not worth taking the chance , John . MULDOON : ( into phone ) Sustain winds 45 knots . HAMMOND : ( nods ) Tell them when they get back to the cars . MULDOON : ( into phone ) Thanks , Steve . ARNOLD : ( making an announcement to the others ) Ladies and gentlemen , last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes . Drop what you are doing and leave now . HAMMOND : Damn ! 41ACROSS THE ROOM NEDRY stares at his video monitor , watching the boat . Page 61/139 He 's on the phone with the MATE , whose images he can see on the monitor . seas around the dock are much rougher now . The MATE : We 're not well-berthed here without a storm barrier ! We may have to leave as soon as the last of the works are aboard . NEDRY : ( low voice ) No , no . You stick to the plan . You wait till they're back from the tour . 42EXTFIELDDAY As the weather grows darker , ELLIE , GRANT , HARDING , and MALCOLM are grouped around an enormous spoor of triceratops excreta that stands at least waist high and is covered with BUZZING flies . MALCOLM : That is one big pile of shit . Ellie has plastic gloves on the reach up to her elbows , and is just withdrawing her hand from the middle of the dung . ELLIE : ( to Harding ) You 're right . There 's no trace of lilac berries . That 's so weird , though . She shows all the classic signs of Meliatoxicity , ( thinking aloud ) Every six weeks - She turns and walks out into the open field a few paces , thinking . Malcolm watches her , and looks back at the dung . MALCOLM : to Grant ) She 's , uh - - tenacious . GRANT : You have no idea . MALCOLM : to Ellie ) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything ? 43INTCONTROL ROOMDAY Page 62/139 DENNIS NEDRY is busily and surreptitiously typing a series of commands into his console . On his screen , a cartoon hand winds up a cartoon clock , moving its second hand up to the twelve . The clock rotates around to face us . It has a large green dollar sign in the middle . A big word appears on screen , an option surrounded by forbidding red box . `` EXECUTE , '' it says . 44EXTPARKDAY The skies are really foreboding now , and there 's a sense of growing urgency . ELLIE is by the animal , a short distance away from the group . GRANT is near her , thinking . GRANT : Ellie , I 've been thinking there 's something about the periodicity does n't had up . ELLIE : I know . Tim holds one of the smooth rocks up and calls out , a little timidly . TIM : These look kind of familiar . GRANT : Triceratops was a constant browser , and constant browsers would be constantly sick . ELLIE : Constantly sick . GRANT : Not just every six weeks . ELLIE : Yeah , I know . TIM : I 've seen pictures of these ! Grant turns and looks at him , a little annoyed . TIM : In your fully illustrated book . Grant just rolls his eyes , but Ellie comes over and checks out Page 63/139 the stones . ELLIE : What 's that ? A light goes on in her eyes . ELLIE : Alan - - gizzard stones ! She throws Grant one of the stones . They look at each other in amazement . As before , when they get excited , they talk right over each other . GRANT : Elm that 's it , it explains the periodicity , the - ELLIE : - - the undigested state of the berries because it 's - GRANT : - - totally incidental ( or ) unrelated to the feeding pattern - TIM : What are you guys saying ? ELLIE : ( turning to Tim ) It 's simple , see . teeth - - Some animals like her , do n't have GRANT : - - like birds - ELLIE : - - like birds . What happen is , they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - GRANT : - - a gizzard - ELLIE : - - which is called a gizzard , and it helps them mash Page 64/139 their food , but what happens after a while - GRANT : - - what happens is that after a while , the stones get smooth , every six weeks , so the animal regurgitates them - ELLIE : ( for Tim ) - - barfs them up - GRANT : - - and swallows fresh ones . ELLIE : And when she swallows the stones , she swallows the poison berries too . That 's what makes her sick . ( impressed ) Good work Tim . She looks at Grant pointedly . Tim looks up at Grant too , smiling from ear to ear . Grant GRUNTS , not so easily convinced . THUNDER rumbles as the storm overhead is about to bust loose . GENNARO , scared of more than one thing now , puts his foot down . GENNARO : Doctors , if you please - - I have to insist we get moving . ELLIE : Oh , you know , if it 's alright , I 'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike . Is that okay ? HARDING : Sure . I 've got a gas powered jeep . I can drop her at the visitor 's center before I make the boat with the others . ELLIE : ( to Grant ) I 'll catch up with you . You can go with the others . GRANT : Are you sure ? Page 65/139 ELLIE : I 'll just finish . Yeah , I want to finish . There is a lightning flash now , with a tooth-rattling THUNDERCLAP right on its heels . GENNARO : Now . Grant turns and follows the others , Lex right in his tracks . Ellie and Harding go back to the triceratops , which is starting to come back to life . As Grant reaches the Explorer , he turns back for one last look at Ellie . He raises his hand to wave , but she is turned the other way . Feeling silly , he drops his hand and goes into the woods . Just as he does , Ellie turns and waves to him , but with his back turned , he misses it too . In this way , they say goodbye . BACK AT THE CARS , as the reflections of the GROUP approach , the first raindrops fall on the windshields of the tour vehicles . They 're big , fat drops , and they kick up little clouds of dust as they SMACK into the glass . It 's going to be a hell of a storm . 45OMITTED 46EXTPARKDUSK It 's near dark now . The wind has whipped up , and the trees are swaying . 47INTCONTROL ROOMDUSK HAMMOND is with RAY ARNOLD , staring at the video screens . ARNOLD : I found a way to re-route through the program . turning the cars around in the rest area loop . I'm HAMMOND : Rotten luck , this storm . Get my grandchildren on the radio will you ? I do n't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain . Arnold reaches for the hand microphone . ACROSS THE ROOM , DENNIS NEDRY , sweat forming on his upper lip now , is staring at his video monitor . The supply boat is still docked on the island shore , but is now being buffeted by heavy waves . Nedry whispers sharply into the phone , arguing with the MATE of the ship again , who he can see on the video monitor . Page 66/139 MATE : There 's nothing I can do ! go , we got ta go ! If the Captain says we got ta NEDRY : No , no , listen to me . You 've got to give me this time . I did a test run on this thing and it took me twenty minutes . I thought I could do it in fifteen - - you've got to give me fifteen minutes . MATE : No promises ! No promises ! NEDRY : I 'll be there in ten ! Arnold SNAPS a button on his console . ARNOLD : Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage . HAMMOND : So how much for our first tour . sick triceratops . Two no-shows and one ARNOLD : It could have been worse , John . It could have been a lot worse . Dennis Nedry stands up . He 's shaking in his shoes , but trying like hell to be casual . NEDRY : Anybody want a Coke ? Anybody what some from the machines ? Or a soda or something ? I had too many sweets . ( or ) I thought I 'd get something sweet . Hammond and Arnold shake their heads . Nedry starts to leave , then turns back with an afterthought that is so rehearsed its almost obvious . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) Oh , I finished de-bugging the phones , but the system's compiling for eighteen minutes , or twenty . So , some minor systems may go on and off for a while . There's nothing to worry about . Simple thing .... Page 67/139 HAMMOND : Okay , okay , okay , okay , that 's enough ! Ahh ! Nedry turns , stretches one finger out to his screen , and selects an option . `` EXECUTE . '' At the same time , he presses the start button on his digital stopwatch he holds in his hand . A digital clock on the computer screen starts to tick down from sixty seconds , and a musical clock starts to sound too - - something like the `` Jeopardy '' theme . He starts to leave - - but returns when he remembers the shaving cream can . He grabs it and leaves . 48EXTPARK ROADNIGHT Night was completely fallen now , and the rain has started . It's a tropical storm , the rain falling in drenching sheets on the roofs and hoods of the Explorers , which are making their way slowly back to the visitor 's center . IN THE REAR CAR , GRANT and MALCOLM are alone . Grant is staring out the window , lost in his thoughts . GRANT : You got any kids ? MALCOLM : Me ? Oh , hell yes . Three . ( glowing ) I love 'em . I love kids . Anything at all can and does happen . He takes a flask from jacket pocket and unscrews the top . expression darkens . MALCOLM ( cont 'd ) Same with wives , for that matter . His GRANT : You 're married ? MALCOLM : Occasionally . Always on the lookout for the future exMrs . Malcolm . 49INTFERTILIZATION LABNIGHT DENNIS NEDRY , waits outside the silver door marked `` EMBRYONIC COLD STORAGE , '' staring at the digital stopwatch in his hand . Page 68/139 NEDRY : Two - - one - On cue , the security lock panel goes dark and the door CLUNKS ajar . IN THE COOLER , Nedry hurries in and flips open the hatch on the bottom of the shaving cream can , revealing slotted compartments inside . He goes to the rack of dozens of thin glass slides . A sign says `` VIABLE EMBRYOS - HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE ! '' He takes the slides out of the rack one by one . They 're labeled - - `` STEGOSAURUS '' , `` APATOSAURUS '' , `` TYRANNOSAURUS REX '' - - and puts them into the can . 50INTCONTROL ROOMNIGHT ARNOLD is staring at his terminal , puzzled . On the screen , glowing red and blue lines are blinking off , in succession .. ARNOLD : What ? HAMMOND comes up behind him , as does ROBERT MULDOON . HAMMOND : What ? ARNOLD : The door security systems are shutting down . HAMMOND : Well , Nedry said a few systems would go off-line , didn't he ? 51 THRUOMITTED : 52 53INTREAR CARNIGHT GRANT and MALCOLM still wait in their car . They do n't notice , but the video screen in the middle of their front console suddenly goes black . Malcolm continues their conversation . MALCOLM : By the way , Dr. Sattler - she 's not like , uh , available , is she ? - GRANT : Page 69/139 Why ? MALCOLM : Why ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Are you two , uh - - are ? I wish you the best luck . The cars jerk to a stop . The lights in the vehicles and along the road go out , plunging them into blackness . Grant jerks his hands away from the steering column , immediately assuming it 's his fault . GRANT : What 'd I touch ? ! MALCOLM : You have n't touched ( or ) did n't touch anything . ( or ) We 've stopped . We 're stopping . GRANT : I must 've touched something . This happens all the time . It must be my fault . Machines hate me . MALCOLM : Machines hate you ? GRANT : Yeah , they hate me . MALCOLM : You want to talk about this ? GRANT : No . 54EXTJURASSIC PARKNIGHT Nedry 's jeep SPLASHES up to the giant gates that lead into Jurassic Park . NEDRY jumps out and hurries to the control panel on the side of the cement supports . He FLICKS a switch and gates CLICK unlocked . He jumps back in the car and noses into the gates , shoving them open far enough to drive through . He ROARS into the park grounds 55EXTCONTROL ROOMNIGHT RAY ARNOLD stares at his terminal , aghast , as row upon row of Page 70/139 colored lights crawls off on his screen . ARNOLD : Woah , woah , woah , what the hell , what the hell ? HAMMOND : What now ? ARNOLD : Fences are failing , all over the park ! systems , he said ! A few minor HAMMOND : ( to Muldoon , pissed ) Find Nedry ! Check the vending machines ! ARNOLD : The monitors are failing . Muldoon heads for the door just as all the video monitors in the control room go out with a faint electronic ZIP . The three of them freeze for a moment , looking at each other . The tension in the room goes up a notch . HAMMOND : ( to Arnold ) Use Nedry 's terminal . Get it all back on . He can debug later . ARNOLD pushes off on the floor and whizzes over to Nedry's master terminal in his chair . With one stroke of his arm , he brushes all the loose junk off Nedry 's station - junk food , soda cans , torn out magazine pages - - and tries to work . ARNOLD : God , look at this workstation . The `` Jeopardy '' -type music is playing a little faster now . Muldoon steps forward , growing alarmed . MULDOON : The raptor fences are n't out , are they ? ARNOLD : ( checks ) No , they 're still on . Page 71/139 HAMMOND : Why the hell would he turn the others off ? ! 56EXTPARK ROADNIGHT A wire mesh fence in front of us has a very clear sign : DANGER ! ELECTRIFIED FENCE ! This Door Can not Be Opened When Fence is Armed ! A hand reaches out , grabs the fence by the bare wire , flips a latch , and shoves the door open . No sparks fly . DENNIS NEDRY runs from the fence back to his jeep , drops it in gear , and tears off down the park road . The rain is absolutely flowing down now , the road is rapidly turning to mud . IN THE JEEP , Nedry can barely see through the windshield . He 's driving as fast as possible , checking his watch every few seconds . He leans forward , squinting to see through the windshield , wiping off the condensation with his free hand . A fork in the road rushes into view . He jumps on the brakes - - to late . The jeep careens into a signpost . NEDRY : Shit ! He throws the door open and hurries to the fallen sign : `` To The Docks '' . He props it up - the directional arrow swings hopelessly on a nail . He clenches his jaws and growls . Soaked , Nedry stomps back to his car . Although he does n't look too convinced , he drops the car in gear and speeds off to the left . 57EXTCONTROL ROOMNIGHT HAMMOND still hovers over ARNOLD 's shoulder while he works at Nedry 's terminal . Arnold MUTTERS to himself as he tries another command . ARNOLD : - - access main program grid - He punches a button , but a BUZZER sounds and a little cartoon image of Nedry appears on the screen and waves its little finger disapprovingly . CARTOON NEDRY : '' You did n't say the magic word ! '' ARNOLD : ( livid ) Page 72/139 Please , God damn it ! I hate this hacker crap ! He SMACKS the top of the monitor , furious . The game show music plays still faster . HAMMOND : Call Nedry 's people in Cambridge ! Arnold whisks across the floor in his chair and snatches up the nearest phone . He punches for an outside line . ARNOLD : Phones are out too . HAMMOND : Where did the vehicles stop ? 58EXTTYRANNOSAUR PADDOCKNIGHT BAAA ! The goat that was brought up from the underground earlier is still tethered in the same place , BLEATING in the pouring rain The two explorers sit still in the middle of the road . A man's form races back from the front car to the rear car . IN THE REAR CAR , GRANT , soaking wet , gets back into the care and closes the door behind him . MALCOLM turns to him . GRANT : Their radio 's out too . Gennaro said to stay put . MALCOLM : The kids okay ? GRANT : Well , I did n't ask . Why would n't they be ? MALCOLM : Kids get scared . GRANT : What 's to be scared about ? the power . It 's just a little hiccup in MALCOLM : I did n't say I was scared . GRANT : I did n't say you were scared . Page 73/139 MALCOLM : I know . GRANT : Fine . Malcolm turns and looks out at the driving rain , and the fence that stands between them and the tyrannosaur paddock . He is scared . 59IN THE FRONT CAR , GENNARO , LEX , and TIM wait , bored . The rain drums on the roof monotonously . Tim is upside down in the front seat . Lex pushes his legs up , and he swings them down . TIM : Up and down , up and down ! GENNARO : ( sotto ) I ca n't believe we invited Ian Malcolm . TIM : People were gettin ' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - LEX : ( a little dreamy ) I think Dr. Grant is really - - smart . GENNARO : How he 'll write a butch of ( letters ) papers , go on Larry King Live , say we 're irresponsible - Tim climbs into the back seat . Lex hits him with her hat as he moves by her . LEX : Do n't scare me . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ? ? ? ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Tim finds something under the seat and sits up abruptly , holding what looks like a heavy-duty pair of safety goggles . GENNARO : Hey ! Where did you find those things ? TIM : Page 74/139 In a box under my seat . GENNARO : Are they heavy ? TIM : Yeah . GENNARO : Then they 're expensive . Put them back . He leans back and closes his eyes . Tim ignores him and puts on the goggles . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Tim stares out the back window of the Explorer with Grant and Malcolm in it , behind them . The image is bright fluorescent green . TIM : Oh , cool ! Night vision ! As Tim watches , the door of the rear Explorer opens , and a hand reaches out , holding an empty canteen out to catch some rain water . 60IN THE REAR CAR Grant pulls the canteen back in , closes the door , and takes a drink . He and Malcolm wait . 61IN THE FRONT CAR Tim continues to stare out of the back window with the goggles . He swings his legs - - but suddenly stops . He feels something . He pulls off the goggles and turns back . He moves into the back seat with Lex who is tapping her hat , and reaches forward to still her hand . BOOM . BOOM . BOOM . TIM : Did you feel that ? ( or ) Can you feel that ? She do n't answer . Tim leans over to the front passenger seat and looks at the two plastic cups of water that sit in the recessed holes on the dashboard . As he watches , the water in the glasses vibrates , making concentric circles - - - then it stops - - - and then it vibrates again . Rhythmically . Like from footsteps . BOOM . BOOM . BOOM . Page 75/139 GENNARO : ( not entirely convinced ) What is that ? M-Maybe it 's the power trying to come back on . Tim jumps into the back seat and puts the goggles on again . LEX : What is that ? GENNARO : What is what ? Tim turns and looks out the side window . He can see the area where the goat is tethered . Or was tethered . The chain is still there , but the goat is gone . BANG ! They all jump , and Lex SCREAMS as something hits the Plexiglas sunroof of the Explorer , hard . They look up . It 's a bloody , disembodied goat leg . GENNARO : Oh , Jesus . Jesus . Tim whips around to look out the side window again . His mouth pops open , but no sound comes out . Through the goggles , he sees an animal claw , a huge one , gripping the cables of the `` electrified '' fence . Tim whips the goggles off and presses forward , against the window . He looks up , up , than cranes his head back further , to look out the sunroof . Past the goat 's leg , he can see - - - Tyrannosaurus rex . It stands maybe twenty-five feet high , forty feet long from nose to tail , with an enormous , boxlike head that must be five feet long by itself . The remains of the goat hang out of the rex 's mouth . It tilts its head back and swallows the animal in one big gulp . Gennaro ca n't even speak . His hand claws for the door handle , he shoulders it open , and takes off , out of the car . LEX : ( freaking out ) He left us ! He left us alone ! Dr. Grant ! Dr. Grant ! He left us ! He left us ! 62ON THE ROAD , Gennaro runs away , as fast as he can , right past the second car , towards a cement block outhouse twenty or thirty yards away . He reaches it , ducks inside , and pulls the door after him - - Page 76/139 - - but there 's no latch , door . Gennaro backs into The whole bathroom begins 63IN THE REAR CAR , Grant and Malcolm turn in just a round hole in the unfinished a stall , frantic . to shake . the direction Gennaro went . GRANT : Where does he think he 's going ? MALCOLM : When you got ta go , you got ta go . Malcolm looks the other way , out the passenger window . As he watches , the fence begins to buckle , its post collapsing into themselves , the wires SNAPPING free . MALCOLM : What was that all about ? - Grant now turns and watches as , ahead of them , the `` DANGER ! '' sign SMACKS down on the hood of the first Explorer . The entire fence is coming down , the posts collapsing , the cables SNAPPING as - - - the T-rex chews its way through the barrier . They watch in horror as the T-rex steps over the ruined barrier and into the middle of the park road . It just stands there for a moment , swinging its head from one vehicle to the other . 64IN THE FRONT CAR , The rex strides around to the side of the car and peers down , from high above . Tim leaps into the front seat and pulls the driver's door shut . Both kids are terrified , breathing hard , unable to speak . TIM : Please ! Please ! 65IN THE REAR CAR , MALCOLM : Boy , do I hate being right all the time . GRANT : Look at that ! The T-rex turns and strides quickly back towards them . It circles , slowly , bending over to look in at them through the window . Grant and Malcolm sit trembling in the front seat , watching as the giant legs stride past their windows . GRANT : Page 77/139 ( a quivery whisper ) Keep absolutely still - - it 's vision 's based on movement ! MALCOLM : You 're sure ? ! GRANT : ( pause ) Relatively . Malcolm freezes as the rex bends down and peers right in through his window . The dinosaur 's giant , yellowing eye is only slightly smaller than the entire pane of glass The T-rex pulls away slightly , then reaches down and BUMPS the car with its snout , rocking it . 66IN THE FRONT CAR , Lex is rummaging around in the back cargo area , looking for something , anything . She finds a flashlight . 67ON THE ROAD , The front car lights up from within as Lex switches on the flashlight . The dinosaur raises its head . It turns slowly from the second car to the first car , drawn by the light . Making a decision , it strides over to the first vehicle . FAST . 68IN THE FRONT CAR , Tim and Lex can only stare out of the windows as the T-rex reaches their car and starts to circle it . The rex bends down and looks in through the front windshield , then the side window . Tim is eye to eye with the thing for a second , then the dinosaur raises its head up , above the car . LEX : I 'm sorry - - I 'm sorry - TIM : Turn it off , Lex ! Turn it off ! Tim climbs over the seat and joins Lex . TIM ( cont 'd ) Where is the button then ? LEX : I do n't know , I do n't know . I 'm sorry - - TIM : Page 78/139 Why did you do this ? LEX : I do n't know ! I 'm sorry ! The Kids look up , through the sunroof , as the head goes higher , and higher , and higher , and then the rex turns , looks straight down at them through the sunroof , opens its mouth wide and - - - ROARS . The windows RATTLE , Lex SCREAMS , the flashlight goes on again , and the tyrannosaur strikes . SMASH ! The thing 's head its the plastic sunroof , knocking the whole frame right out of the roof of the car and down into the vehicle . The bubble falls down onto Tim and Lex , trapping them , and the animal lunges down , through the hole , SNAPPING at them . The Plexiglas holds , though and protects Tim and Lex even as it pins them to the seats . The T-rex continues to push down , and the glass GROANS , crack lines racing across it . Tim , whose feet were caught above him , pushes back , only an inch of glass between him and the dinosaur 's teeth . 69IN THE REAR CAR , Grant and Malcolm watch in horror as the dinosaur claws at the side of the vehicle with one of its powerful thigh legs . It pushes , starting to tip the car over . MALCOLM : Oh my God ! GRANT : We got ta do something . MALCOLM : What ? What can we do ? GRANT : There 's got ta be something - Grant looks around , climbs over the seat . He tears apart the back area , searching - and finally finds a metal case . He opens it , finding flares . He grabs one and moves quickly back to the driver's seat and opens the door . Malcolm grabs a flare , too . 70IN THE FRONT CAR , the glass windows SHATTER , the Kids are thrown to the side , and the Explorer tilts . The rex bends down and nudges the car with its head , rolling it Page 79/139 up on its side . Tim and Lex tumble around . 71ON THE ROAD the T-rex starts to nudge the Explorer toward the barrier . Over the barrier , there is a gentle terraced area at one side where the rex emerged from , but the car is n't next to that , it 's next to a sharp precipice , representing a fifty or sixty foot drop . The car , upside down now , is pushed near the edge . The rex towers over the car . Like a dog , its puts one foot on the chassis and tears a the undercarriage with its jaws . Biting at anything it can get a hold of , it rips the rear axle free , tosses it aside , and bites into a tire . The tire EXPLODES , startling the animal . 72INSIDE THE CAR , Tim and Lex are trapped inside the rapidly flattening car . As the frame continues to buckle , they crawl toward the open rear window , the car collapsing behind them . Mud and rain water pout into what little space there is left . Tim is ahead , nearing the back window , when there is a CRUNCH and a seat comes down , pinning him . 73ON THE ROAD , the dinosaur backs up , dragging the Explorer , swinging it left and right . It seems ready to fling it over the edge . Grant gets out of his car . He 's holding the flare in one hand , which he pulls the top off of . Bright flames shoot out the end of it . GRANT : Hey ! Hey ! Over here ! The T-rex turns and looks at him Grant waves the flare slowly in front of him from side to side . The T-rex follows his moving arm , eyes locked on the flare . Grant looks over to the wall , and tosses the flare over the edge of the barrier . The rex lunges after it - Unclear with Grant 's plan , Malcolm leaps out of the car and tries to scare up the T-rex 's attention with his own newly lit flare . He begins to wave it at the animal . Grant sees him - GRANT : Ian ! Freeze ! Freeze ! Get rid of the flare ! MALCCOLM : Get the kids ! Malcolm inches back slowly , then takes off , running for his life down the road . He runs to the cement block outhouse Gennaro went into earlier . Page 80/139 The T-rex sees the movement . It whirls and takes off after Malcolm , fast . Malcolm runs as fast as he can , approaching the outside just steps ahead of the T-rex But not far enough ahead . Without even slowing down , the rex leans forward and flicks Malcolm into the air with its snout . It 's just a nudge a for the rex , but it sends Malcolm sailing right through a wooden portion of the wall , and into the building . 74IN THE RESTROOM Gennaro , who cowers in a corner , SCREAMS as teh head of the Trex EXPLODES through the front of the building , sending chunks of cement flying in all directions inside . The roof collapses ; Gennaro tries to protect himself from the falling junk . 75ON THE ROAD Grant gets on his feet and watches as the T-rex noses around in the rubble . It seems to find something . It lunges , and Grant can hear Gennaro SCREAMING , the sound piercing - - - until it abruptly stops . Grant scrambles over to the car . GRANT : Tim ! Lex ! LEX : Dr. Grant ! Dr. Grant ! He lays on the ground , looking inside , and sees Lex staring up at him , conscious , her face covered in mud . GRANT : Are you okay ? Can you move ? ( calling into the car ) Tim ! Are you okay ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -VERSION 1- - - - - - - - - - - - - - GRANT : Tim , are you okay ? TIM : I 'm stuck . The seat 's got my feet ! GRANT : Tim , I 'll come back for you . I 'll get Lex out first . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -VERSION 2- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Page 81/139 LEX : He 's knocked out ! He 's knocked out ! Grant ! Daddy , daddy ! Dr. Grant ! Dr. GRANT : Let 's get you out . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Grant reaches in and drags her out . GRANT : Are you okay ? Good girl . Grant tries to find Tim GRANT ( cont 'd ) Tim ? Tim ? Lex , staring over his shoulder , SCREAMS . Grant whirls , covering her mouth at the same time . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Shhh ! Do n't move ! It ca n't see us if we do n't move . Lex looks at him like he 's crazy , but freezes . They wait . BOOM ! A big T-rex foot print smacks down in front of them as the dinosaurs approaches the car again . It leans down , right past them , and SNIFFS the car , ragged bits of flesh and clothing hanging from its teeth . Not finding anything , the dinosaur swings its head away , SNORTING loudly through its nose . Grant 's hat flies off his head . Still , he does n't move . The rex walks to the back of the car . It bends down . WHAP ! The car spins as it is pushed from behind by the rex . Grant and Lex are pushed in front of it , helpless . They scramble around on their knees , trying to keep ahead of the car , which the rex is now pushing even closer to the edge of the barrier . Grant and Lex crawl quickly , but the car is moving faster , catching up on them . 76INSIDE THE CAR Tim awakens and SCREAMS . He tries to untangle himself . 77ON THE ROAD , the T-rex looms over Lex and Grant , who are trapped between the car and the sixty foot drop . 78INSIDE THE CAR , the rex bends down and sees Tim . Tim backs away , furiously , but there 's almost no room to move in there . The rex opens its mouth wide and stretches its tongue into the car . Tim screams and kicks as the tongue tries to wrap around him . Page 82/139 But it fails , and withdraws from the car . 79ON THE ROAD , the T-rex still tries to get to Grant and Lex , pushing the car , spinning on its roof . Grant and Lex scramble , trying to avoid being caught by the T-rex and crushed by the car . GRANT : This way ! The back of the car almost crushes them against the barrier - GRANT ( cont 'd ) Get back ! They move , as the rex continues to move the car towards the edge . Grant finally gets on the wall , Lex follows . The T-rex ROARS in frustration . It bends down for one final lunge at the car . Grant sees it coming . He grabs one of the dangling fence cables on the other side of the barrier . GRANT : Grab a hold of me ! She wraps her arm around his neck . He scrambles to the edge of the barrier , and starts to climb down . LEX : ( screaming ) Timmy ! Timmy ! The cable is slick with rain , and it 's all Grant can do to hang on as he and Lex slide rapidly down . Above them , the vehicle is now teetering over the edge , threatening to drop right on top of them if they did n't hurry . Grant GASPS , as Lex has unwittingly started to choke him as she holds on for dear life . GRANT : You 're choking me ! The car GROANS , nearly over the edge now . Grant looks to the side . There are other cables , out of the line of the car 's impending drop . His feet scrambling along the concrete wall , Grant tries to swing over towards one . GRANT : Grab a wire ! But he falls short . His momentum carries them back the other way , but on the second swing Lex manages to grab hold of the second Page 83/139 cable . LEX : I got it ! The car falls . Lex and Grant are clear by inches , clinging to the second cable . LEX : Timmy ! The car CRUNCHES into the leafy top of a tree , resting on its roof some fifteen feet below them . The T-rex stares down at them , but they are safely out of its reach . It ROARS once more , in a final fit of frustration , turns - A80INTCONTROL ROOMNIGHT JOHN HAMMOND is lived HAMMOND : I will kill Nedry . I will kill him . Muldoon bursts through the door . HAMMOND : ( to Muldoon ) Well ? MULDOON : There 's no sign of him anywhere . The game show music is louder and faster now , very annoying . HAMMOND : Ray will you please switch off ( or ) stop that music ? ! RAY ARNOLD 's cigarette is practically burning his lips , down to almost nothing in his mouth . He hovers over NEDRY 's computer terminal , which is a mass of incomprehensible commands that scroll by quickly as he futilely examines each one of them . MULDOON paces . ELLIE stares at Arnold in amazement . ELLIE : Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours ? I mean , what 's hanging us up ? ARNOLD : Page 84/139 I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today . It 's all pretty standard stuff , until this one - ELLIE : ( stands , joins the group at the computer ) What one ? He points to his computer screen , to a specific series of commands . The others crowed over his shoulder and stare at the screen . ARNOLD ( cont 'd ) '' Keycheck /space -o keycheck off safety -o . '' He's turning the safety systems off . He does n't want anybody to see what he 's about to do . Now look at this next entry , it 's the kicker . `` Wht.rbt.obj . '' Whatever it did , it did it all . But with Keycheck off , the computer did n't file the keystrokes . Only way to find them now is to search the computer 's lines of code one by one . ELLIE : How many lines of code are there ? ARNOLD : Uh - - about two million . ELLIE : Two million - - great . That would help . ( or ) Oh good , that 'll take no time . HAMMOND : Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind ( or ) good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren . MULDOON : Sure . ELLIE : I 'm going with him . They head for the door . Hammond turns , staring out the windows at the front of the control room . He 's gone pale , and he 's sweating , wrapped up in million thoughts . Behind him , Ray Arnold 's voice calls to him , but he does n't hear it . Page 85/139 ARNOLD : John - - John - Hammond leans on his cane , and for the first time he looks like he 's actually using it . ARNOLD ( cont 'd ) John . Hammond turns , finally hearing him . ARNOLD ( cont 'd ) I ca n't get Jurassic Park back on line without Dennis Nedry . 80EXTPARK ROADNIGHT As the rain continues to pour down , a gas-powered jeep ROARS down another park road . 81INTJEEPNIGHT DENNIS NEDRY drives the jeep as fast as he can in the treacherous conditions . He MUTTERS to himself , shaking his head . NEDRY : Shoulda been there by now - - shoulda been there - He hauls it around a corner and looks down , checking his watch . When he looks back up , his eyes go wide . There 's a white wood guard rail fence , right in front of him . He stands on the brakes as hard as he can . The jeep fishtails , skidding out of control in the mud towards the fence . Nedry hauls the wheel hard to the side to try to control the skid , but the jeep skids off the road , going halfway over the muddied embankment . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) God damn it ! He drops the car in reverse and hits the gas . The wheels spin , sending mud flying everywhere , but the jeep goes nowhere , just digs in further . Nedry ca n't believe it . Frustrated , he gets out of the jeep . He stops suddenly - he can see another park road , down the sloping embankment , about twenty feet below . There is a large sign alongside the road . Nedry leans forward excitedly to get a better look . It reads `` TO EAST DOCK . '' He scrambles to the front of the jeep . ON THE HILLSIDE : Nedry CRANKS a winch its coil on the front end of the jeep . NEDRY : Page 86/139 ( mumbling to himself ) No problem . Winch this sucker off the thing - - tie it do a thing - - pull it down the thing - - and pull it back up . He loses his balance and slips - falling back on his rear . He slides down the muddy embankment , across the road below . Pissed , he gets to his knees and searches for his glasses . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) Where are my glasses ? I can afford new ones . He stands and grabs the winch , and goes to a sturdy-looking tree on the other side . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) You can make it ! From the distance , there is a soft HOOTING sound . There 's some movement in the bushes - Nedry looks around for the source of the sound and movement . He does n't find it . He nervously checks his watch and goes back to the winch , but faster . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) No problem - - pop this thing right down - The HOOTING comes again and Nedry turns - again , nothing . A figure ducks around the tree and pops out on the other side , HOOTING playfully . Nedry looks around one side of the tree - nothing . It pops up on the other side , HOOTING again . And Nedry looks again . Nothing . It seems like a friendly game of hide-and-seek . But Nedry begins to get rattled . NEDRY : That 's nice . Got ta go . I 'm getting out of here . C'mon you can make it ! He secures the winch and starts across the road , back up the embankment . He freezes , as he feels something behind him . He turns around slowly and sees : A dilophosaur . It stands only about four feet high , its spotted like an owl , and has a brilliant colored crest that flanks its head . It does n't look very dangerous . In fact , it 's kind of cute . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) Oh . Uh - - nice boy . Nice boy . Okay . Run along . I do n't have anything for you ! Go on ! Go home ! Dinner time ! Are you hungry ? They 'll feed you ! Go , boy . Girl . Whatever . The dilophosaur just stares at Nedry , tilting its head curiously . Nedry looks around on the ground and finds a stick . He picks it up and chucks it at the thing . He throws it as far as he can . Page 87/139 NEDRY ( cont 'd ) Nice juicy stick ! Fetch ! The dilophosaur gets into the spirit of the game , but not the object . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) Lame brain ! What 's the matter with you ? ( or ) What 's the matter with you ? He shakes his head and starts back towards the jeep , muttering to himself . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) Walnut brain ... extinct kangaroo ... hope I run over you on the way down - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ? ? -OR- ? ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - NEDRY ( cont 'd ) Walnut brain ... extinct kangaroo ... hope I run over you on the way down - He 's near the top when the dilophosaur suddenly hops out right in front him , startling him . Nedry loses his balance and falls back , right on his rear . He gets to his feet , angry . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) I said - He picks up a stick and chucks it at the thing . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) - - beat it ! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - NEDRY ( cont 'd ) What are you do - The animals HISSES . The brightly colored fan around its neck flares wildly , two bulbous sacs on either side of its neck inflate . It rears its head back again - - - and it SPITS . SPLAT ! A big glob of something wet SMACKS into the middle of Nedry 's chest . He reaches down and touches the goo that 's dribbling down his slicker . NEDRY ( cont 'd ) That 's disgusting ! SPLAT ! Another glob of goo SMACKS into the highlight , right next to Nedry 's head . He stands up . A look of confusion crosses his face . He lifts his right hand , the one that he touched the spit with , and looks at it strangely , flexing it . POW ! This time the lugie hits Nedry right smack in the face . He SCREAMS and rubs it away , frantically . Page 88/139 Because it hurts . Like hell . Nedry falls back , clawing at this eyes , in excruciating pain . He pulls his hands away , starting to hyperventilate . He flails his arms in front of him , blinking a mile a minute , but blinded . He staggers forward , to try to get into the jeep . He gets the door open , but SMACKS his head on the door frame and collapses . The can of shaving cream flies out of Nedry 's jacket pocket - and tumbles into runoff water , down the muddy hillside . Nedry gets to his feet again and staggers in the general direction of the jeep . He reaches the open door and feels his way in . He SLAMS the door . There is another HOOT . From inside the jeep . Nedry turns and SCREAMS . The dilophosaur is right there , in the passengers seat . It HISSES louder than before , its crest fans angrily , vibrating , reaching a crescendo - - - and the thing pounces , SLAMMING Nedry back against the driver 's window , SHATTERING it . As Nedry shrieks - Rain and mud wash over the shaving cream can , burying it . 82OMITTED 83EXTPARK GROUNDSNIGHT The rain has all stopped now . GRANT and LEX are at the bottom of the large barrier leading up to the park road . Like it or not , they 're in the park now , and are surrounded by think jungle foliage on all sides . They 're both beaten up , and Grant 's face is covered in blood . He 's bent over a big puddle , splashing water on his face , rinsing the blood off and trying to bring himself to . Poor Lex is scared as hell . She stands behind Grant , ramrod straight , her breath coming short , desperate GASPS . Her eyes are wide , and she does n't look like she can move . As Grant gets rid of the blood , his injury does n't look so bad , just a gash on his forehead . He turns and looks up to the tree the Explorer fell in . It's stuck there , nose down in the thickest top branches . Lex 's GASPS are getting louder . She 's terrified . GRANT : Hey , come on , do n't - - do n't -- do n't - - just - -just - - stop , stop . He touches her , but it 's awfully awkward , more of a pat on the head than anything strong or reassured . But she responds to the contact , hurling herself forward and throwing her arms tightly around his waist . She clamps here , holding on for dear life , SOBBING . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Page 89/139 Lex , you got ta be quiet , please . Stop it . Shhhhh . This seems to quiet her . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Because if we make too much noise , he 's going to hear us and come back . Lex bursts out crying again , a WAILING scream , nearly hysterical now . Grant holds her , no idea what to do . He turns and looks around . GRANT ( cont 'd ) ( a whispered shout ) Timmy ? ! Timmy ! He hears a CRACKING sound . He looks up to the tree again . The Explorer has fallen a few feet lower into the branches . Grant looks down at Lex , who is sitting on a rock . LEX : Dad - - Dad - GRANT : Shhh - - I 'm right here , Lex . I 'm going to look after you . I 'm going to help your brother . I want you to stay here and wait for me , okay ? LEX : He left us ! He left us ! GRANT : That 's not what I 'm going to do . Good ! Grant walks to the tree . Lex scampers into the culvert . 84EXTTREE-NIGHT GRANT takes a deep breath . grabs hold of the first branch , and starts his long climb . Fortunately , it 's a good climbing tree , its branches thick and regularly spaced . Grant moves at a good pace . He reaches the car 's level , on the driver 's side five or six feet to one side of it . The car 's in rough shape . It 's much thinner that it use to be , its nose completely smashed in , the front wheels driven solidly into a thick branch . They are what hold it in place . GRANT : Tim ? Tim ? Grant comes up to the car and looks in . TIM is huddled on the floor on the passenger side , frightened , hugging his knees to his chest . He looks up at Grant with a tear and blood-streaked faced . His Page 90/139 voice is barely audible . TIM : I threw up . GRANT : That 's okay . Listen , give me your hand . Tim does n't move . GRANT ( cont 'd ) I wo n't tell anybody you threw up . Just give me your hand , okay ? He reaches out . Tim reaches too , but they 're still about a foot apart . Grant grabs hold of the steering wheel , to pull himself further in . The wheel turns . On the branch , the front wheel turns , losing a bit of their grip on the thick branch they 're resting on . Tim and Grant grab hands . Grant holds on to him , getting an arm securely around his waist . They climb down . They stop on a branch . GRANT : Okay , that 's not so bad , ah Tim ? TIM : Yes it is . GRANT : It 's just like coming out of a tree house . ever build you a tree house , Tim , eh ? Did your dad TIM : No . GRANT : Me too . ( he starts to move down ) Okay . Well , the main thing about climbing is never , never look down , never . TIM : This is impossible . How am I going ... I ca n't make it . This is ... it 's about fifty feet . GRANT : So am I going to help you with your foot ? Page 91/139 TIM : What if the car falls ? ( or ) What if the wheels fall ? The car GROWNS forward on the branch , which sags in their direction . They look up . The car begins to shift dramatically towards them . GRANT : Oh , no ! GO , Tim , go ! Go ! They climb down , as fast as they can , as the big branch that is supporting the car CREAKS , ready to give way any second . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Faster ! Faster ! The branch breaks . Disintegrates , really , and the car falls straight at them . Grant and Tim let go of the branch they 're on and fall , THUDDING into another branch a few feet down . The car SMACKS into the bug branch they just vacated , and stops there . Grant and Tim are half climbing , half falling down the tree now , slipping on the resin-covered branches , just trying like hell to get out of the way . CREEEE-POW ! The second branch breaks , and now the car SMASHES and CRASHES through a network of thinner branches , headed right for them . It hits open space and goes into free fall . Grant turns , and puts up his arms in defense -- - and the car stops , SLAMMING into a thick branch just above him . Grant looks up , eyeball to eyeball with the front grill . The new branch starts to CREAK . Grant and Tim basically fall down the rest of the tree , the car BASHING its way through right behind them . They jump the last six or seven feet and hit the ground , hard . Grant grabs Tim and rolls with him , to the side , just as the car SMASHES into the earth , nose first , standing upright that way . They look up in relief , but the damn thing 's still heading for them , now tipping over , falling straight at them , and there 's no way they have time to get out of the way this time , so Grant just balls himself up on top of Tim to try to protect him and -- - CRASH ! The jeep falls on top of them . Grant , amazingly unhurt , looks up confused . They 're inside the jeep again , saved by the hole sunroof . Page 92/139 CUT TO : 85EXTCULVERT-NIGHT LEX is still in the culvert , terrified , slowly BANGING her head against the wall . GRANT is at the mouth of the culvert , carefully studying the rinky-dink map of the park he picked up during the slide show . GRANT : Okay -- okay -He 's trying to get his bearings from the crude , cartoon-like drawing on the map , but it 's tough . He looks up , picking a direction , and shoves the map in his pocket decisively . He looks back in at Lex . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Lex , you 're going to have to get out of there . ( he walks towards her ) Hiding is n't a rational solution ; we have to improve our situation . She does n't move . Grant looks at Tim . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Tim 's out here . ( Grant picks Tim up ) He 's okay . Still nothing . Grant tries a new tact . GRANT : ( walking away ) 'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help . TIM : ( following Grant ) That 's a good idea . GRANT : You 'll probably be safe enough ( alone ) on your own -TIM : I doubt it . GRANT : Maybe -- it 's hard to say . Page 93/139 LEX : Liar ! You said you would n't leave ! GRANT : I 'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain , you know ! She just stares at him like he 's nuts . Tim shakes his head at Grant , as if to say `` nice try . '' Grant calms his tone . - - - - - VERSION 1 - - - - GRANT ( cont 'd ) We ca n't go back the way we came . What we have is a free-range T-rex on the road . There 's ( there are ) fences on either side . If we meet him between here and the lodge , we 'd have problems . But what this means , what this means , is that this whole paddock is empty . It 's safe . LEX : It 's safe ? GRANT : It 's safe . LEX : It 's safe . GRANT : Go ( and ) that 's the way we 're going to go . say ? What do you LEX : Alright . - - - - - END - - - - - - - - - VERSION 2 - - - - GRANT ( cont 'd ) Alright . We 're just going to walk back home . Together . We walks over to Lex at the culvert and sits across from her . GRANT ( cont 'd ) But we ca n't walk back on the road . There are fences on either side . And if we meet the Rex between here and the lodge we 'd -- have problems . Lex covers her ears . Grant tries to calm her . GRANT : Page 94/139 He 's probably staked out the road as a feeding ground , which means this whole paddock is empty . It 's safe . It 's safe , and that 's the way we 're going to go . What do you say ? - - - - - END - - - - He 's spoken calmly and confidently , so Lex crawls out of the culvert and stands next to him . GRANT : Good girl . He kisses her hand and helps her crawl out of the culvert . Tim and Lex nod , and he starts off in the direction he indicated . They trail behind him . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Might be kind of slow , but it ca n't be more than three or four miles . I 'd hoped the rex finished feeding by now , but let 's not kid ourselves . Did you know a carnivore can eat up to 25 % of its body weight in ( about ) one sitting , so he 's probably just ready to move on to the main course by now -He stops in the middle of the sentence , noticing he 's alone . He turns around . Now both kids have scampered all the way back into the culvert , terrified . 86EXTPARK ROADNIGHT MULDOON and ELLIE race down the park road in an open-topped jeep like the one Nedry took earlier . Neither of them speak , they just stare ahead grimly , wondering what they 're about to find . MULDOON : There they are ! They round a corner and come to the top of the hill , where the attack took place . The jeep skids to a stop and they jump out . The road is rutted , muddy mess . The cement block house is a pile of rubble . One of the Explorers is gone , the other stands untouched , both doors hanging open . ELLIE : Oh , God . Where 's the other car ? She runs to the Explorer . Muldoon follows , looking around . AT THE EXPLORER , Ellie leans in and looks around . Nobody 's there . She and Muldoon walk towards the wreckage of the outhouse , calling out : ELLIE ( cont 'd ) I think it 's ahead of us . Page 95/139 MULDOON : It could be anywhere . With the fences out , it can go in and out of any paddock it likes . They hear a MOANING sound from somewhere in the wreckage of the restroom building . They rush over to it . IAN MALCOLM lies on his back , semiconscious among the twisted wood and cement . MULDOON : It 's Malcolm ! He shines his light along the length of Malcolm 's body . His shirt is soaked with blood , but his right leg is even worse off . right ankle it bent outward at a strange angle from his leg , the trousers flattened , soaked with blood . Malcolm 's belt has been twisted around his thigh . ELLIE : He 's put a tourniquet on . Ian ! Ian ! Malcolm GROANS as she touches him , groggy . MALCOLM : Remind me to talk John for a lovely weekend . The T-rex ROARS again . But closer now . Ellie and Muldoon look at each other . ELLIE : Can we chance moving him ? MALCOLM : Please - - chance it . Muldoon lays Malcolm as carefully as possible in the back of the jeep . MALCOLM : Where are the kids ? Ellie looks around . ELLIE : Lex ! Tim ! She turns and looks back at the empty road . of tears , but is fighting them back . MULDOON : Page 96/139 She 's on the verge The Dr. Sattler , I 've seen a lot of animal attacks . People just disappear . No blood , no trace . That 's the way it happens . ELLIE : No , no , no ! She walks to the edge of the road , her eyes following the deep ruts the Explorer made when it went over the edge . Muldoon gets ready to leave . MULDOON : Ellie , com one ! ! ELLIE : The other car ! 87EXTCLEARINGNIGHT ELLIE 's and MULDOON 's flashlight beams spray light by the base of the tree . MULDOON : Dr. Grant ! ELLIE : Alan ! They find the wrecked Explorer . for anything . Muldoon peers inside , looking ELLIE : Do you see anything ? MULDOON : I do n't know . The T-rex ROARS again , closer still Ellie nervously goes to the other side of the car and looks in . ELLIE : Alan ? ! MULDOON : They 're not here . Ellie desperately searches the ground for any signs of Grant . She finds their footprints . ELLIE ( O.S . ) Thank God . Page 97/139 88EXTPARK ROADNIGHT MALCOLM , laid out in the back of the jeep , feels something strange . He looks down , at the one of the T-rex footprints in the road . It 's filled with water . The water in the puddle vibrates rhythmically . Malcolm 's eyes widen . He looks around , frantically . MALCOLM : Uh - - anybody ? Anybody hear that ? 89EXTCLEARINGNIGHT ELLIE is still looking around , to MULDOON 's chagrin . Her flashlight falls on three sets of footprints in the mud . ELLIE : Look ! Wit her flashlight , she follows the trail the footprints made . They lead into the jungle and disappear . 90EXTPARK ROADNIGHT MALCOLM 's staring , wide-eyed , at the rings in the water , which are getting bigger now . MALCOLM : It 's a - - an impact tremor is what it is , it , uh - BOOM . BOOM . MALCOLM ( cont 'd ) I 'm fairly alarmed here ! ELLIE and MALCOLM come up over the embankment , excited . MALCOLM : Got ta move , got ta get out of here . Let 's go - we got ta go , we got ta get out of here , right now ! Go , go ! Let 's hurry , let's get out of here ! They stop talking . The BOOMING is louder now , and faster . Much faster . They look back , over their shoulders . ELLIE : Oh . Ellie and Muldoon get into the jeep , Muldoon in the driver's seat . MALCOLM : Move now ! Let 's go , let 's go , right now , right now ! The tyrannosaur SMASHES out of the jungle foliage , bursts onto the road , and runs straight at them , moving at least thirty miles an Page 98/139 hour . MALCOLM : GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO ! Muldoon fumbles for the keys , turns the jeep over , and SLAMS it into gear . He drops the clutch , hits the gas , and tears ass out of there . But the jeep is slow to work through the first few gears . Terrified , Ellie dares to look down , to the side view mirror , which tells her `` Objects Are Closer Than They Appear . '' And they sure are . The T-rex is still gaining on the slowly accelerating jeep . All three of them stare back at the rex in terror ELLIE : Faster , faster ! MALCOLM : Must go faster , it 's getting closer - must go faster ! ELLIE : Faster ! Shit , shit , shit , faster ! MALCOLM : Must go faster , go , go . Open it up , 5th gear , 5th gear ! Here it comes ! Stand on it ! Fifth - stand on it , 5th gear , go ! - - which means they do n't see the half-fallen tree branch right in front of them , blocking the path of the road . Muldoon looks back first , SHOUTS - MULDOON : DOWN ! - - they all duck . The windshield hits the branch and SHATTERS as the jeep flies ahead , really picking up speed now . The T-rex just runs right through the branch , SMASHING it entirely . They 're bounced around pretty badly . Malcolm is knocked into the front , and in so doing knocks the gear shift into neutral . The engine RACES , the T-rex closes in again - Losing ground now , the dinosaur makes a final lunge for the jeep and CRUNCHES into the left rear quarter panel - - Page 99/139 ELLIE : Faster , faster ! - - but Muldoon SLAMS it back into gear and guns it . The T-rex gives up , fading into the distance . They drive in silence for a few moments , all scared out of their wits . MALCOLM : Think they 'll have that on the tour ? 91EXT PARK GROUNDNIGHT GRANT , LEX , and TIM make their way through Jurassic Park . Far in the distance , there 's another ROAR . Grant hears it , but tries not to show it . LEX : Hear that ? ( or ) Are you hearing this ? GRANT : No , I did n't hear anything . ( or ) No , we 're okay . They keep walking , but now Grant is place to hide . He looks up , to the GRANT ( cont 'd ) You ( guys ) both look pretty tired . ( or ) why do n't we find ( or ) we ought to find someplace to rest . He hears another ROAR GRANT ( cont 'd ) Like about now . C'mon ! Hurry up ! looking around for a safe towering trees around them . I think Like this tree . LEX : Why are we hurrying if there 's nothing wrong ? TIM : What if we fall ? I hate trees . 92EXTTREENIGHT LEX , TIM , and GRANT climb . Grant is behind , watching the other two , giving them a push up when they need it . Page 100/139 TIM : I hate trees ! LEX : They do n't bother me . TIM : Yeah , you were n't in that last one . Now , near the top of the tree , the three of them sit there , dangling their legs , looking out over the park . It 's an incredible view . They can see in all directions . And with the full moon , there 's a lot of detail . Most striking of all are dozens of sauropod heads , at the end of long necks , that tower over the park . TIM ( cont 'd ) Hey ! Those are brontosauruses - - I mean , those are brachiosauruses . GRANT : It 's okay to call them brontosaurs , Tim . It 's a great name . It 's a romantic name . It means `` thunder lizard '' . TIM : ( digging that ) '' Thunder lizard ! '' Grant finds a solid web of branch and settles himself in it , leaning back against the trunk of the tree , with a little room on either side of him . Lex nestles up next to him on the branch . Grant is surprised , but accepts it . Tim climbs off to the side , to a nook in the branch of his own . Silent of a moment , the three can hear the HOOTS of the animals as they call . Some are almost musical . GRANT : Listen to that ! They 're singing ! ( he moves over to a higher branch ) Of course no one 's ever heard one from a dinosaur before , but - - I could swear that sounds suspiciously to me like a mating call ( to me ) . In an all-female environment - ( or ) On an all-girl island ? He smiles , enchanted . He HOOTS himself , trying to imitate one of the calls . Immediately , five or six of the heads turn in their Page 101/139 direction and HOOT back . LEX : No , no , sh , sh , sh - - stop ! monsters come over here ! Stop ! Stop ! Do n't let the LEX : They 're not monsters , Lex . They 're just animals . these are herbivores . TIM : That means they only eat vegetables . think they 'd make an exception . And But for you , I GRANT : Tim , Tim , Tim .... LEX : Oh , I hate the other kind . GRANT : They 're just doing what they do . ( or ) Well the other kind - ( he gets off the branch and goes back to sit with the kids ) - - just do what they do . LEX : Dorkatops ! TIM : Straight-A brainiac ! GRANT : Could you guys possibly cool that for a - Satisfied , Tim settles in for the night . Grant shifts too , getting comfortable , but something in his pocket pinches him . He winces and digs it out . It 's the velociraptor claw he unearthed so long ago in Montana Yesterday , actually . He looks at it , thinking a million thoughts , staring at this thing that used to be so priceless . LEX : Page 102/139 What are you gon na do now if you do n't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more ? GRANT : I guess we 'll just have to evolve too . TIM : What do you call a blind dinosaur ? GRANT : I do n't know . What do you call a blind dinosaur ? TIM : A Do-you-think-he-saurus . What do you call a blind dinosaur 's dog ? GRANT : You got me . TIM : A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex . Grant laughs . Both kids finally close their eyes , but after a moment , Lex pops hers open again . LEX : What if the dinosaur comes back while we 're all asleep ? GRANT : I 'll stay awake . LEX : ( skeptical ) All night ? GRANT : All night . Grant lets the claw fall to the ground . 93OMITTED 94INTRESTAURANTNIGHT ELLIE comes into the darkened restaurant , following the source of the flickering light . A candle burns at a table in the corner . JOHN HAMMOND sits at the table , alone . There is a bucket of ice cream in the middle , and he 's eating a dish of it , staring down morosely . Page 103/139 Ellie draws up to the table and Hammond looks up at her . His eyes are puffy , his hair is messed up - - for the first time we 've seen him , the fire is gone from his eyes . HAMMOND : They were all melting . ( or ) It was all melting . Ellie just nods . ELLIE : Malcolm 's okay for now . I gave him a shot of morphine . HAMMOND : They 'll all be fine . Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert ? Ellie nods . Another pause . Hammond breaks it again . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) You know the first attraction I ever built when I came down south from Scotland ? Was a Flea Circus , Petticoat Lane . Really quite wonderful . We had a wee trapeze , a roundabout - - a merry-go - - what you call it ? ELLIE : Carousel . HAMMOND : A carousel - - and a seesaw . They all moved , motorized of course , but people would swear they could see the fleas . `` I see the fleas , mummy ! Ca n't you see the fleas ? '' Clown fleas , high wire fleas , fleas on parade ... ( he trails off ) Ellie just looks at him , not sure what his state is . He goes on . HAMMOND : But with this place , I - - I wanted to give ( show ) them something real , something that was n't an illusion , something they could see and ( feel ) touch . An aim devoid of ( without ) merit . ELLIE : But you ca n't think through this one . it . You have to feel Page 104/139 HAMMOND : You 're absolutely right . Yes , you 're right . Hiring Nedry was a mistake , that 's obvious . We 're overdependent on automation , I can see that now . But that's all correctable for the next time around . ELLIE : John , John . John , you 're still building onto that Flea Circus , that illusion . And now you 're adding onto it by what you 're doing here . That 's the illusion . HAMMOND : ( When ) Once we have control again we - ELLIE : Control ? ! You never had control ! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place . So I made a mistake too . I did n't have enough respect for that power , and it 's out now . You 're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces . John , there 's nothing worth picking up . The only thing that matters now are the people we love . Alan , Lex , and Tim . And John , they 're out there where people are dying - - people are dying , you know ? There is a long pause . Hammond avoids her gaze . Ellie reaches out and takes a spoon out of one of the buckets of ice cream , and licks it . Finally : ELLIE ( cont 'd ) It 's good . He looks up at her , and his face is different , as the unhappy irony of what he 's about to say finally hits home . HAMMOND : Spared no expense . 95OMITTED 96EXTPARKDAWN The sun comes up over Jurassic Park . The danger of the night before is overcome by the sheer beauty of the place - - it really is like the Serengeti Plain . Over at the edge of a great open field , a huge tree marks the border between the open area and the thick of the jungle . UP IN THE TREE , GRANT , TIM , and LEX are asleep in the branches of the tree , both Page 105/139 kids now curled up under Grant 's arms . A heavy shadow falls over all three of them , blocking out the sun entirely . Grant awakens , only a little bit asleep , as - - - a brachiosaur 's head pushes into the tree branches , right up beside them . It hesitates there for a second , seemingly staring at them . Grant just watches as it opens its mouth very wide and CHOMPS down on a branch over their heads . The kids awaken with a start . Tim points , Lex opens her mouth to scream , but nothing comes out . Then - LEX : Go away ! GRANT : ( quietly ) It 's okay ! It 's okay ! It 's a brachiosaur ! TIM : Veggiesaurus , Lex , Veggiesaurus ! But Lex is n't taking any chances and scrambles back , away from its mouth . Tim and Grant come together on the branch , just staring at the dinosaur in wonder as it eats its breakfast . Grant gets another branch . Tim scampers up , trying to get the brachiosaur 's attention . TIM ( cont 'd ) Come here , boy - - I mean girl . ( he tries whistling ) Grant moves forward and tries to feed the brachiosaur . The animal gets the end of the branch and starts a tug-of-war with Grant . Tim tries to help him - - they really begin to have a good time with the brachiosaur . HONK ! The brachiosaur makes a loud honking noise , startling Grant and the kids . GRANT : Take a bite , take a bite . I 'm not letting go . TIM : It 's so strong ! Look at its nose . ( he grabs onto the branch ) Need help ? Tim reaches out , petting the dinosaur 's head while it chews . TIM ( cont 'd ) That 's a girl . Hey Lex , you can touch it . It 's a girl , Page 106/139 just like you . Come on , it 's okay . Lex , come on and touch it . It likes you . It 's got ta like you . Come on Lex . Lex , come over and touch - - it 's a girl , it has to like you . Lex , why do n't you touch it . It has to like you . It 's a girl . GRANT : Come on , try some . Take a bite . TIM : It 's good protein . Come on , Lex . it ? Look at his nose . Why do n't you touch GRANT : This is a seventy-seven ton animal . Come on over , Lex ! Just think of it as a big cow . Look at it 's teeth ? ( he moves in closer ) Come here , girl . This is a seventy-seven ton animal . Just think of it as a big cow ! Grant maneuvers in closer . He reaches out and grabs hold of the thing 's lip with both hands and pulls it down , revealing the jaw at work . LEX : I like cows . GRANT : You 're a beautiful big animal . TIM : His nose is running . It looks like it has a cold . The dinosaur keeps chewing , not objecting to the inspection . TIM : Did you smell that ? Lex tentatively edges forward in the tree to the inspection . LEX : Come on girl , up here . She barely touches the thing on the tip of its nose - - - and it SNEEZES . It 's a vast explosion , and Lex falls back , dripping wet from head to toe . TIM : Page 107/139 God bless you ! 96AOMITTED 97ON THE GROUND , Lex , her shirt is soaked , and face all wet , walks away from the tree . Tim and Grant follow . TIM : Oh , great . Now she 'll never try anything new ! Lex is embarrassed and ticked off . TIM ( cont 'd ) She 'll just sit in her room and never come out and play with her computer - LEX : ( as she wipes off some of the wet and throws it at Tim ) I 'm a hacker ! TIM : That 's what I said ! You 're a nerd ! They do n't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds ! Tim and Lex continue talking , oblivious to Grant , who has stopped by a tree root trunk . TIM : Hey Lex , ahhhchooo ! ( or ) Hey Lex , com here . LEX : What ? TIM : Hey Lex , you forgot to say gazundheit . Grant is still crouching on the ground below the tree where he landed , staring at something in the palm of his hand . They both come and look over his shoulder , curious . They stare in amazement - - - at a whole clutch of dinosaur eggs ! All hatched , now empty . Grant picks up one of the fragments , a large one - nearly half an egg . GRANT : You know what this is ? It 's a dinosaur egg . dinosaurs are breeding . Page 108/139 The TIM : ( taking the shell from him ) But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls . GRANT : Amphibian DNA . LEX : What 's that ? GRANT : Well , on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps . They mutated the dinosaur 's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs . Now , some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female , in a single sex environment . Malcolm was right ! Look , life found a way ! 98INTCONTROL ROOMDAY The mood in the room is hopeless . MALCOLM , his wounds bandaged , but in real pain , hangs around with ELLIE and MULDOON , hoping for some development while RAY ARNOLD is still at the computer terminal and looking a mess , he doggedly sorts through the computer system 's lines of code . One . By one . By one . They BLIP by , reflected in his glasses . He turns and stares up at HAMMOND with a look of absolute incredulity on his face . ARNOLD : No , no , no , that 's crazy , you 're out of your mind , he's absolutely out of his mind - ELLIE : Wait a minute . What exactly does this mean ? Hammond turns to her , the twinkle back in his eye . HAMMOND : We 're talking , my dear , about a calculated risk , which is the only option left to us . We will never find the command NEDRY used . He covered his tracks far too well , and I think it 's obvious he 's not coming back . So shutting down the system - ARNOLD : I will not do it . You 'll have to get somebody else , Page 109/139 because I will not . HAMMOND : - - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did . If I understand correctly , all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct ? ARNOLD : Theoretically , yeah ( yes ) , but we 've never shut down the whole system . It may not come back at all . ELLIE : But would we get the phones back ? ARNOLD : Yeah , again , in theory , but - MULDOON : ( desperate ) What about the lysine contingency ? into effect ! We could put that ELLIE : What 's that ? HAMMOND : It 's absolutely out of the question . Hammond walks away from the group . ARNOLD : The lysine contingency - it 's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island , but we could use it now . Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism . Animals ca n't manufacture the amino acid lysine . Unless they 're continually supplied with lysine by us , they'll go into a coma and die . ELLIE : How would we cut off the lysine ? ARNOLD : No trick to it . Just stop running the program . Page 110/139 Leaving them unattended . Malcolm speaks up . MALCOLM : How soon before they become comatose ? ARNOLD : It would be totally painless - - they 'd just slip into unconsciousness and they die . MALCOLM : How long before they slip into unconsciousness ? ARNOLD : About - - seven days , more or less . ELLIE : Seven days ? ! clever . Seven days ? ! Oh , great . Oh good - - MALCOLM : That 'll - it 'd be a first ; man and dinosaur all die together . John 's plan . ( he raises a hand ) Hammond finally loses his cool . He BELLOWS , summoning every ounce of authority at his command . And that 's quite a bit . HAMMOND : PEOPLE ARE DYING ! There is a moment in which no one dares to speak . regains himself . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) Will you please shut down the system . Arnold swallows and gets to his feet . Hammond ARNOLD : You asked for it - He walks slowly across the room to a red metal box on the wall . He takes a key from his belt , unlocks the door , and opens it . There is a row of four switches inside . He flips them off , one by one , leaving only a single lever left . His hand hovers over it . . . and he flips the lever . ARNOLD ( cont 'd ) - - and you got it . Page 111/139 Every monitor , every terminal , every fluorescent light shuts out . plunging them into near-darkness . They just sit in eerie stillness for a moment . ELLIE : ( hushed voice ) How long will this take ? ARNOLD : 'Bout thirty seconds . They wait , in tense silence . Hammond adjusts the wilting silk handkerchief in his breast pocket . He notices Malcolm staring at him , his eyes full of disapproval . HAMMOND : I think perhaps I 'll just sit down . I do n't suppose you think all that much of me now , do you ? MALCOLM : You 're all right , John You 're okay . It 's just you don't have intelligence . You have `` thinktelligence . '' You think narrowly and call it `` being focused . '' You don't see the consequences . You 're very good at solving problems , at getting answers - - but you just do n't know the right questions . ELLIE : Ian - Malcolm looks at her . MALCOLM : Yes ? ELLIE : - - shut up . MALCOLM : Yes . ( to Hammond ) It 's not a criticism , by the way . Finally , Arnold turns back to the box . He flips the row of safety switches back again , then hesitates by the main switch . ARNOLD : Page 112/139 Hold on to your butts . He throws it . And nothing happens . There is a very long pause . MALCOLM : It 's not working . ARNOLD : Uh - MULDOON : Listen , which of you knows how to handle a gun ? Arnold , who ca n't quite understand this , races over to the main monitor ARNOLD : ( joyously ) HAH ! It 's okay ! It 's okay ! Look ! See that ? ! LOOK ! They stare at the monitor , which glows with a faint amber light , the only mechanical thing in the room that 's on . The left hand corner of the screen displays two words - /system ready . Arnold looks at them , his face triumphant . ARNOLD ( cont 'd ) It 's on ! It worked ! HAMMOND : That will teach you to trust Grandpa . MALCOLM : Wait a minute ? is still off ! What do you mean `` worked '' ? Everything ARNOLD : The shutdown must have tripped the circuit breakers . All we have to do is turn them back on , reboot a few systems in here - - the phones , security doors , half a dozen others - - but it worked ! System ready ! MULDOON : Where are the breakers ? ARNOLD : Out in the maintenance shed . Other side of the compound . I 'll go out there . Three minutes , and I can Page 113/139 have the power back on in the entire park . HAMMOND : Just to be safe , I 'd like to have everybody in the emergency bunker until Mr. Arnold returns , and the whole system is back on its feet again . CUT TO : A99EXTCOMPOUNDDAY MULDOON and ELLIE carry a Gerry rigged stretcher with MALCOLM on it down a narrow path in the compound . HAMMOND is with them . CUT TO : 96DEXTPARK GROUNDSDAY GRANT , TIM , and LEX walk through the park grounds , heading across a relatively open area . Grant consults the map . TIM & LEX I 'm tired , and I 'm hungry . When I get back I 'm gon na have peanuts and ... etc . GRANT : The visitor 's center should be just about a mile beyond that rise . If we keep - The ANIMAL CRY they heard earlier is closer now , louder , and repeated by many more animals . Grant looks up . GRANT ( cont 'd ) What is that ? Can you tell me what they are ? TIM : Gallimimus . He turns around , to face the direction the sound is coming from . He squints . The ANIMAL CRY are much louder now , accompanied by a low rumble . TIM ( cont 'd ) Here - - they 're flocking this way . Grant takes a few steps forward . As he watches , he can make out shapes in the distance . Dinosaurs . Dozens of them . All at once , he figures it out . GRANT : STAMPEDE ! And that 's exactly what it is , a stampede of at least forty dinosaurs , Gallimimus by name . Lex is ready to get out of there , but Grant and Tim hesitate , staring . Page 114/139 The dinosaurs kick up a flock of birds , which startles them , and they call change direction at once , the same way . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Look at the wheeling - - the uniform direction change ! Like a flock of birds evading a predator ! Sure enough , they hear a ROAR , the very familiar roar - - - of Tyrannosaurus rex . GRANT : Oh , shit . Grant and the kids whirl at the sound , but ca n't place it , as it seems to come from all around them . They look back towards the stampede . The herd spontaneously changes direction again , and now they 're headed straight at them . The three of them take off , across the meadow , toward the relative cover of the jungle . It 's a real footrace , but the herd is far faster , and Grant knows they 're not going to make it . They jump over a huge root network . There 's a space under it to hide , and Grant stops the kids , shoves them underneath , then follows them . They cover their heads as the herd THUNDERS over the roots . Chunks of everything fly everywhere as the herd plows overhead , their clawed feet striking the roots dangerously close to Grant and the kids . Finally , they pass . Grant peers up , over the top root . He looks toward the trees , which the herd is now running alongside . A ROAR comes from somewhere within the trees . Grant scans the trees , looking for any sign of the T-rex - - - and then it bursts out , ahead of the herd , cutting them off , throwing them into disarray , scattering them everywhere . They all stare as the rex kicks it into overdrive , runs down one of the Gallimimus , and sinks its teeth into its neck . The T-rex makes the kill in a cloud of dust and debris . Tim and Grant half rise to their feet , staring in wonder . LEX : I wan na go - -now ! But Grant and Tim are transfixed , watching the T-rex . GRANT : Watch how it eats ! LEX : Please ! Page 115/139 GRANT : Bet you 'll never look at birds the same way again ! Tim nods in fascination . The T-rex pauses in the middle of its meal and ROARS . LEX : Let 's go ! GRANT : Okay . Keep low . Follow me . She turns and takes off , running as fast as she can , across the open plain . Tim and Grant tear themselves away and follow her . TIM : Look at all it 's blood ! CUT TO : 97 THRUOMITTED : 101 100INTBUNKERDAY ELLIE paces impatiently . She comes down the stairs . ELLIE : Something 's happened . Something went wrong . MULDOON paces too . HAMMOND and MALCOLM are also crammed in the underground bunker . Malcolm lays on a table , while Hammond tries to tend to his wounds . Hammond speaks , still feeling the obligation of the host . HAMMOND : This is just a delay , that 's all this is . All major theme parks have had delays . When they opened Disneyland in 1956 , nothing worked , nothing . ELLIE : John .... MALCOLM : But , John . But if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down , the pirates do n't eat the tourists . Another pause . More pacing . Page 116/139 ELLIE : I ca n't wait anymore . Something went wrong . to go get the power back on . I 'm going MULDOON : You ca n't just stroll down the road , you know . HAMMOND : Bob , let 's not be too hasty . He 's only been gone - ( he looks at his watch ) Muldoon walks over to a steel cabinet . Ellie joins him . MULDOON : I 'm going with you . ELLIE : Okay . Muldoon CLANGS open a steel cabinet , revealing an impressive array of weaponry inside . He removes a shotgun and what looks like a small rocket launcher . He shoves a shell into the barrel of the rocket launcher , which accepts it with a faint electronic SIZZLE . Hammond searches out the set of blueprints , gets them out of the file cabinet and spreads them out on top of Malcolm almost crushing his leg . HAMMOND : Sorry . Ellie and Muldoon join Hammond . HAMMOND ( cont 'd ) This is n't like switching on the kitchen light , but I think I can follow this and talk you through it . Hammond signals with a look . ELLIE : Talk . ( or ) Right . ( or ) ( nothing ) Ellie gets a couple of walkie-talkies from the shelf and shoves them in her belt . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) Okay . Page 117/139 HAMMOND : But you know , I should really be the one going ( to go ) . ELLIE : Why ? HAMMOND : Well , because you 're a - - I 'm a - ELLIE : Look . MULDOON : Come on , let 's go . ELLIE : We 'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back . ( she backs towards the door ) You just take me through this step by step . I 'm on channel two . CUT TO : 101EXTJUNGLEDAY GRANT , TIM , and LEX scrambles through the jungle , completely out of breath , exhausted . They arrive at the base of the big electrical fence that surrounds the main compound . Grant looks up at the fence . It must be over twenty feet high . GRANT : It 's a bit of a climb . You guys think you can make it ? TIM : Nope . LEX : Way too high . Grant grabs a stick and climbs up on the ledge . He looks at the warning light on the fence . It 's out . He pokes the wire with a stick . No sparks fly GRANT : Well , I guess that means the power 's off . Still not trusting the fence , he taps it with his foot . Page 118/139 He moves in slowly and lays both hands on a cable and closes his fingers around it . Grant 's body shakes ! He SCREAMS . The kids SCREAM ! He stops , and turns around slowly ... and smiles wickedly . LEX : That 's not funny . TIM : That was great ! Far in the distance , the T-rex ROARS . both kids leap to their feet . Without a second 's delay , CUT TO : 102EXTBUNKERDAY ELLIE and MULDOON step out of the bunker . The main compound feels different now - - it belongs more to the jungle than to civilization . Muldoon has the big gun in his hands . ELLIE : ( on the radio ) Okay , I 'm on channel two . MULDOON : Stick to my heels . They start down the path , moving quickly . 102AEXTPATHDAY MULDOON and ELLIE emerge from one path and come into a slightly more open area . The huge raptor pen stands silently , surrounded and penetrated by jungle , the abandoned goon toward looming over it like a haunted house . Muldoon slows down , Ellie right next to him . They notice a hole in the fence that surrounds the raptor pen . The metal is twisted , as if gnawed , the hole is large enough for an animal to slip through . ELLIE : Oh my God . Aw , God . MULDOON : The shutdown must have turned off all the fences . Goddamn it ! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence . 103 Page 119/139 He squats near the hole , looking at the ground . He sees three sets of footprints . He follows them with his eyes . They head off in different directions , but all in the jungle foliage on either side of them . MULDOON : C'mon on , this way . ELLIE : I can see the shed from here ! We can make it if we run ! Muldoon walks slowly , as if he heard something . MULDOON : No . We ca n't . ELLIE : Why not ? MULDOON : Because we 're being hunted . From the bushes straight ahead . Ellie turns , very slowly , to face the bushes . At first , she does n't see anything , but then there 's something very faint , like a shifting of the light , and a shadow seems to move in the bush , RUSTLING the leaves . MULDOON : It 's all right . ELLIE : Like hell it is ! Muldoon raises his weapon slowly to his shoulder . MULDOON : Run , towards the shed . I 've got her . Ellie backs up , down the path , slowly . Muldoon follows behind her , keeping his gun trained in the bushes . The shadow in the bushes moves too , at an even pace with them . MULDOON : Go ! Ellie , startled , turns and falls over a log . She quickly stands and starts to run towards the shed . Muldoon walks slowly into the bushes . Page 120/139 ON THE PATH , Ellie runs as fast as she possibly can - - a real broken field sprint , hopping over branches , flying across the open area at top speed . Over a log - - SPLASH ! , she hits a water puddle . She comes to another log obstacle - - she grabs a tree and swings over it . She nears the maintenance shed , and does n't look back . She reaches the door , blasts through it , and SLAMS it behind her . CUT TO : 104EXTJUNGLEDAY A hand comes into the foreground and takes a firm grip on one of the tight fence cables . Another hand follows it , then a third . GRANT , TIM , and LEX climb over the fence , pulling themselves up by the tension wires , crawling right past a `` DANGER ! '' sign that tells them this fence ought to be electrified . 105INTBUNKERDAY MALCOLM and HAMMOND hover over a complex diagram of the maintenance shed that 's spread out in front of them . Hammond clutches the radio in his hand , almost praying to it . Finally , it CRACKLES . ELLIE ( o.s . ) I 'm in . Mr. Arnold ? Mr. Arnold ? 106INTMAINTENANCE SHEDDAY ELLIE is at the doorway of the maintenance shed , breathing hard from fear , listening to Hammond 's VOICE on the radio HAMMOND ( o.s . ) Great . Good . Okay - - ahead of you should be a metal stairway . Go down it . Ellie does , heading into the room , shining the flashlight ahead of her . There is a maze of pipes . ducts , and electrical work on both sides of her . 108INTSHEDDAY ELLIE walks straight ahead from the bottom of the metal stairs . HAMMOND ( o.s . ) Right . After twenty or thirty feet , you 'll come to a T junction . Take a left . MALCOLM ( o.s . ) John . just have her follow the main cable - HAMMOND ( o.s . ) I understand how to read a schematic . Ellie keeps walking , nervous as hell . She looks around . Awfully dark down here . ELLIE : Page 121/139 Going down the stairs ... okay ... damn it ! Dead end ! HAMMOND ( o.s . ) Wait a minute , wait a minute , there was a right back there somewhere - MALCOLM ( o.s . ) ( taking over ) Ellie ? ! Look above you - - there should be a large bundle of cable and pipes all leading in the same direction ! Follow that ! Ellie looks up , finds the bunch of cables , and follows it into a main corridor . ELLIE : ( into the radio ) Piping ... okay ... following the piping . It goes back up the stairs and across the stairs ... following the stairs . HAMMOND ( o.s . ) Look for a metal grate and that to it 's longest direction . ( * ADDED DIALOGUE , NOT RECORDED ) ELLIE : Mr. Arnold ? grating . He 's not answering me . HAMMOND : Good ! Keep going , now . big , gray box . Okay I 'm on the The cable will terminate in a ELLIE : Okay , I 'm following the tubing . I 'm going down a passage way . How long does this stuff go for ? Could you guys talk a little bit to me ? ( NOTE : Spielberg wants Malcolm to say something funny to Ellie over the radio ; she smiles ) Walking fast Ellie follows the tubing to the end of the corridor , where she sees just a box . ELLIE : ( into the radio ) Okay - - I see the gray box . Page 122/139 Ellie goes through a mesh gate and walks towards the gray box . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) It says `` High Voltage '' . She pushes the door open even further , revealing a vast array of breakers and switches inside . HAMMOND ( o.s . ) Now , Ellie , you ca n't just throw the main switch by hand , you have to pump up the primer handle to give you a charge . It 's a large , flat , gray - ELLIE : I see it ! 109 EXTJUNGLEDAY GRANT and the KIDS swig over the top of the fence and start their climb down . 110INTSHEDDAY ELLIE pumps the gray handle , which is sluggish . Above it , a small white indicator CHINGS over the `` discharged '' to `` charged '' . SLAMS the gray lever back into positions . Ellie ELLIE : It 's charged , okay ! HAMMOND ( o.s . ) Right ( good ) ! Now , under the words `` contact position '' there 's a round green button that says `` push to close ! '' Push it ! Ellie does . The `` contact position '' light CHINGS over to '' closed '' and lights start to go on all over the panel . Did I do it ? Is the power back on ? 111EXTJUNGLEDAY GRANT and LEX continue to climb down the fence . Tim is having difficulty - - just as he 's about to take another step , he loses his footing and almost falls ... but then regains control and hangs on . 112INTSHEDDAY ELLIE watches as the column of twelve white indicator lights flash on the control panel . They are clearly labeled , each one for a different area of the park . HAMMOND ( o.s . ) Now Ellie , the red buttons turn on the individual park systems . Switch them on . As Ellie punches the buttons , they light up ... and our eyes go to near the end of the row . It 's marked `` Perimeter Fence . '' 113INTJUNGLEDAY Page 123/139 GRANT lets go , dropping the last few feet to the ground . LEX does the same . A warning light begins to flash , coming back to life . Grants eyes go wide . He looks up at TIM , who is still far up - - near the top , in fact , he has to come to a complete stop . 114INTSHEDDAY ELLIE keeps pushing the buttons . She 's getting closer to the button for the fence . 115EXTJUNGLEDAY TIM , terrified , has frozen where he is . GRANT : Tim - - you have to let go ! 116SHEDDAY ELLIE 's still punching the buttons , now only a half a dozen away from the one for the fence , now five , now three - 117EXTJUNGLEDAY GRANT and LEX are botch screaming at TIM GRANT : C'mon Tim , move down , damn it ! LEX : Timmy ! TIM : I ca n't ! The power is coming down , quick ! I 'm scared ! GRANT : Tim , you 're gon na have to let go . three . LEX : Jump , Timmy ! I 'm going to count to It 's too late ! TIM : I 'm afraid I am gon na fall ! GRANT : Go , go , go , jump ! TIM : You 're crazy ! I 'm not gon na jump ! Page 124/139 GRANT : Tim , you 're going to have to let go of the fence .

Easy catch . Count to LEX : You 're gon na get electrocuted ( or ) electrified ! The power 's coming back ! TIM : Shut up ! You 're scaring me . Stop ! You 're scaring me . GRANT : Shhhh .

GRANT : It 's am easy catch , you let - - go - - you do the counting , you count it , Tim . One , two , three -- you do all the counting , okay ? Page 125/139 LEX : Timmy , listen to Dr. Grant ! GRANT : I 'm coming up there Tim ! I 'm coming to get you ! Lex , I 've got to get him ! 118INTMAINTENANCE SHEDDAY ELLIE finally pushes the button for the fences . It stops flashing and lights up , a brilliant white . 119OMITTED CUT TO : 119EXTJUNGLEDAY The fence HUMS as it awakens . GRANT and LEX are SCREAMING at TIM : TIM : Okay , okay ! I 'm going to count to three . One , two , three .... With a low , loud frightening BUZZ - - - the fence comes alive . POW ! Tim is cut off mid-sentence , and literally thrown from the fence . He SLAMS into Grant . They fall to the ground . Lex runs over to them . GRANT : Tim , you 're okay ? You 're okay ? GRANT notices a larger problem . GRANT ( cont 'd ) He 's not breathing . Tim ? 120INTMAINTENANCE SHED ELLIE watches as the banks of fluorescent lights in the maintenance shed come on , one by one . The lights are going on in rows , coming closer and closer to her . Finally , her row comes on . She follows the light and sees - - - a raptor , right there , behind the control panel ! It SLASHES , taking a lunging sweep at Ellie , but gets stuck , its feet and legs tangled in the maze of pipes on the floor . This is our first good look at one of these things , and if it were n't so terrifying , we could admit that it truly is a thing of beauty . It 's the biggest of the raptors , intensely muscled , coordinated as hell , a smoothly designed predator . Page 126/139 Ellie SHOUTS and falls back into the pipes on the other side of the aisle . The raptor untangles itself from the pipes and gives chase , just as Ellie SLAMS the mesh door closed . The raptor BANGS against the mesh door , Ellie falls to the ground . She holds on by kicking the door shut as the raptor continues to push himself through the door . Ellie is able to get the door closed . She stands , but then falls back onto one of the walls . A dead arm falls onto her shoulder . RAY ARNOLD is there , or what 's left of him , stuck in the tangle of pipes . Ellie moves away , and his arm falls to the ground . She does n't realize that she has moved right back near the mesh wall - - and the raptor comes at her again . Ellie takes off running as fast as she can , back the way she came . She drags the flashlight with her , running over the dead arm and Arnold 's legs . She continues to run , her headset dangling , the flashlight dragging behind her on its cord . She reaches the stairs and hits them hard , flying up them . The raptor must be right behind her , she can hear the CLICKING and CLANGING as it scrambles up the stairs , but she does n't look back . She reaches the top , throws open the door , hurls herself outside - 121EXTSHEDDAY - - and SLAMS the door behind her , just as the raptor 's head SNARLS at her from near the top of the stairs . She runs out the fence and collapses . A121EXTJUNGLEDAY TIM is still unmoving . GRANT is performing CPR , alternately compressing Timmy 's chest fifteen times , quickly , and breathing into his mouth twice . LEX is freaking out . Fifteen compressions . Two deep breaths . GRANT : C'mon , Tim . Fifteen compressions . Two deep breaths . GRANT : TIMMY ! Fifteen compress- Tim GASPS and comes to . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Good boy , Tim . Good boy . Page 127/139 TIM : Three . ( Two , three ) . CUT TO : B121EXTJUNGLEDAY ROBERT MULDOON creeps slowly through the jungle foliage , tracking his prey . He ducks and walks through a hollow log , underneath a fallen tree , following the RUSTLING sound up ahead of him . He can see just a trace of the raptor 's gray flesh as it movies behind the bushes up ahead , staying camouflaged enough to deny him a decent shot . Thinking he 's got a moment , Muldoon extends the back handle of the gun and clicks it into place . He prepares to take aim . A snake slithers across a tree branch , past what looks like the large iris of a flower . The flower blinks . It 's the eye of the raptor . Muldoon sees it . He raises his gun . Instead of running away again , the raptor rises slowly out of the brush , fully revealing itself to Muldoon , HISSING at him . The corners of Muldoon 's mouth twitch up into a smile . He draws a bead on the animal . His finger tenses on the trigger . Suddenly , his smile vanishes , both eyes pop open , and a terrible thought sweeps across his face . His eyes flick to the side - MULDOON : Clever girl . - - which is where the attack comes from . With a ROAR , another raptor comes flashing out of nowhere and pounces on him . The gun BLASTS , but wildly , and the raptor 's claw SLASHES through Muldoon's midsection . Muldoon SCREAMS and falls back , the raptor locked on top of him , all tooth and claw all of a sudden . As the second raptor makes the kill , the first raptor strides slowly forward and watches approvingly . It throws its head back and SNARLS . 122INTVISITOR 'S CENTERDAY GRANT , TIM , and LEX come into the deserted visitor 's center . A large sign that says `` When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth . . . '' droops overhead . Grant now carries Tim , who is weakened but conscious . GRANT : HELLO ? ! But nobody answers . Page 128/139 123INTRESTAURANTDAY GRANT , TIM , and LEX come into the restaurant . Grant carefully sets Tim in a chair at one of the tables . Lex across from him . GRANT : I am gon na have to find the others and get you to a doctor . Will you look after Tim , Lex ? LEX : ( scared as hell ) Yes . Grant nods . He looks at Tim for a second . GRANT : Your hair 's all standing up . He gently rearranges Tim 's hair , which is wild , all over this head . Tim looks up at him weakly and manages a smile . Grant smiles back . GRANT ( cont 'd ) Big Tim , the human piece of toast . Tim laughs . Grant pauses for a second , as if debating something - GRANT ( cont 'd ) Be back soon , guys . I promise . He leaves . As he goes across the lobby of the visitor 's center and outside , they can see his silhouette , moving through a translucent mural that depicts dinosaurs in various natural settings . It 's quiet for a second as Lex and Tim just look at each other . Tim goes across the room , to an all-you-can-eat table on the other side , and quickly piles some food on a tray . He brings its back to the table . Lex digs in , munching on veggies , grabbing food with two hands . Tim enjoys his food , too . Lex comes up with a spoonful of lime Jell-O from a plastic dinosaur egg cup - - but her hand freezes halfway to her mouth . Tim looks up , and sees the expression on her face . She's staring over his shoulder , eyes wide , the Jell-O quivering in her shaking hands . TIM : What ? Tim turns around . Behind him , one of the silhouettes on the mural is a raptor , in a hunting pose . While they stare , the silhouette of a real raptor moves out from Page 129/139 behind it and creeps forward , in the lobby of the visitor 's center . 124INTKITCHENDAY LEX pulls the shiny metal door shut as quietly as she can . It latches with a distinctive CLICK , but there 's no lock . She runs to a panel of lights switches and kills them all , plunging the room into semidarkness . She helps TIM down an aisle and they hide at the end , behind a counter , breathing hard . A raptor 's head pops into view , visible through the round window in the middle of the restaurant door . It just looks for a moment , its breath steaming up the window . THROUGH THE WINDOW , as the steam evaporates , the raptor can see a part of Tim that is not entirely hidden by the counter . IN THE KITCHEN , TIM and LEX remain frozen in fear as the raptor first SNIFFS at the bottom of the door , then THUMPS its head against it . But the door does n't budge . CUT TO : 125EXT COMPOUNDDAY GRANT walks quickly down the narrow path towards Hammond's compound , eyes darting from side to side , not exactly sure where he's going . From far off , he hears someone SHOUTING to him . He turns . He sees ELLIE , standing outside the bunker . She's waving to him , SHOUTING something too faint for him to hear . He furrows his brow and walks towards her . She SHOUTS louder . He walks faster . He 's closer now , and he can finally make out where she 's shouting . ELLIE : Run ! Grant takes off running towards her , not even looking back . He races up , and she runs into his arms . ELLIE ( cont 'd ) Where are the kids ? ! 126INTBUNKERDAY JOHN HAMMOND stands between GRANT and ELLIE in the bunker , watching as Grant RACKS the bolts on a ten gauge shotgun . GRANT : ( to Ellie ) It 's just the two raptors , right ? one 's contained ? You 're sure the third Page 130/139 ELLIE : Yes , unless they figured out how to open doors . CUT TO : 127INTKITCHENDAY OUTSIDE THE DOOR TO THE KITCHEN , the raptor stares down at the door handle , cocking its head curiously . It SNARLS and bumps the door handle with its head , but that does n't do anything . It reaches out , toward the handle , with one clawed hand . IN THE KITCHEN , Tim and Lex stare in shock as the door handle starts to turn . The door opens . The first raptor stands in the doorway , draws itself up to its full height , and looks around the kitchen . Now , a second raptor joins it in the doorway . They move into the room , brushing against each other . The first raptor SNAPS as the second , as if to say `` keep your distance . '' Now the raptors split , taking two different aisles . Tim and Lex crawl away , Tim awfully weak now , down a third aisle , around the other side of the counter from the raptors , moving in the opposite direction . As Tim and Lex pass the raptors , one of the raptor 's tails SMACK into some pots and pans , knocking them off the counter . They fall on the kids , who manage to keep quiet . The kids keep moving as one of the raptors dips down , looking through an open cabinet to inspect the racket . Tim and Lex reach the end of the aisle and round a corner - but Timmy 's falling behind now , and he accidentally brushes against some hanging kitchen utensils . Both raptors turn . One jumps onto the counter , knocking more kitchen stuff to the floor . A ladle CLATTERS to a stop , and the strange metallic sounds confuse the raptors for a moment . But then they move , in Tim 's direction , SNIFFING , heading right for him . The raptor on the floor is just about to turn the corner to where Tim sits , exposed and exhausted , but both the raptors suddenly stop , hearing a CLICKING sound from the other end of the aisle . It 's Lex , TAPPING a spoon on the floor to distract them . The raptor on the counter jumps down and starts cautiously towards Lex's noise , leaving Tim . Lex sees a steel cabinet behind her , its sliding door slid up and open . She crawls inside , silently . Tim sees the raptors make the turn towards Lex , SMASHING more stuff around with their tails . He turns and sees a walk-in freezer in the far wall , with a pin-locking handle . Page 131/139 As Lex tries to pull the overhead door to the cabinet shut , one of the raptors rounds a corner and sees her reflection on a shiny cabinet front . Lex tries frantically to lower the cabinet door , but it 's stuck . Tim takes a few deep breathes , summons what little strength he has left - - - and makes a break for the walk-in freezer . He 's limping , dragging himself , really moving like a wounded prey now , and - - - the other raptor spots him . Both raptors go into a preattack crouch - - - and they pounce , one towards each of the kids . Lex tugs on the cover , to the avail - - Tim 's raptor charges after him , just open floor space between them - - - and Lex 's raptor THUDS into a shiny surface bearing hr reflection . It chased the wrong image . It sags to the floor , semiconscious . At the other end of the aisle , the real Lex SCREAMS as the other raptor bears down on Tim . Tim reaches the freezer , rips the door open , and falls inside . The floor is cold and slick and his feet go right out from under him . He sprawls across the floor , rolls out of the way - - - and the raptor slips and falls into the freezer too , right past him . Tim drags himself to his feet and out of the freezer . The raptor makes one last lunge , right on Tim 's heels , its mouth wide open - - - but Lex SLAMS the door shut just as Tim is clear . The raptor 's head is caught for a second , but it SNARLS , retreats , and Lex 's gets the door shut all the way . The raptor ROARS and SCREAMS inside . Lex jams the pin through the handle , locking it in . Now the other raptor staggers to is feet . Groggy , it SMASHES into stuff all over the kitchen . Lex throws her arms around Tim again for support and they take off . 128INTRESTAURANTDAY TIM and LEX hurry across the restaurant . They stare back over their shoulders as they run . They CRASH into GRANT and ELLIE . LEX : It 's in there ! ELLIE : Control room . 129INTSECOND FLOOR CORRIDORDAY Page 132/139 GRANT , ELLIE , and the KIDS race down the second floor corridor towards the control room , Grant helping Tim . 130INTCONTROL ROOMDAY The door to the control room SMACKS open . GRANT , ELLIE , and the KIDS burst in . Ellie heads straight for Nedry 's computer terminal . Grant moves Tim to the side , and races back to the door to lock it . LEX : We can call for help ? ! ELLIE : We 've got to reboot the system first ! She sits at the computer and studies the screen . It 's flashing to her , dominated by a maze-like grid . She studies it , confused . GRANT : ( at the door ) Oh , no ! The door locks - - Ellie ! Boot up the door locks ! Boot up the door locks ! POW ! Something hits the door , hard , from the outside , the kids SCREAM , Grant hurls his back against it - - Grant loses his gun . struggles . The raptor scratches his head . He ELLIE : ALAN ! - - and Ellie leaps out of the chair and races over to the door to help him . A raptor SNARLS and SNAPS , RAMMING itself against the door , trying to force its way into the control room . It 's all Ellie and Grant can do to hold the door against the onslaught , but it bucks against them viciously . GRANT : ( to Ellie ) Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks ! ELLIE : You ca n't hold it by yourself ! GRANT : Ellie , get the gun ! ( or ) Try to reach the gun ! ELLIE : Page 133/139 I ca n't get it ! ( or ) I ca n't get it unless I move ! OVER AT THE COMPUTER , Lex slides quickly into the command chair at Nedry 's terminal . She stares at the screen for a moment - LEX : This is a Unix system . I know this . It 's the files for the whole park . It 's like a phone book - -it tells you everything . - - and then her fingers start to fly over the keyboard . Tim watches , amazed , as the computer starts to respond to Lex 's commands . LEX ( cont 'd ) I 've got to find the right file . Oh no , this isn't right . This might be right , no this is n't it . TIM : C'mon , Lex ! C'mon , Lex ! Go , Lexie ! Reaching another menu , Lex spots a box on the screen that reads '' DOOR INTEGRITY . '' She reaches out and touches it . The screen BEEPS LEX : There it is , I got it ! This is it , I did it . Yes , yes ! - - and the door latch panel BUZZES . Grant and Ellie put everything they have into it and finally the door SNICKS shut , locking the raptor outside . GRANT : What works ? LEX : Phone security systems , everything works . it , we got it ! You ask for CUT TO : 131 INTBUNKERDAY A phone RINGS . HAMMOND and MALCOLM look at each other , wideeyed . Hammond lunges for it . HAMMOND : Grant ? ! The children alright ? 132INTCONTROL ROOMDAY Page 134/139 All the screens in the control room have come alive now , and data is scrolling by at incredible speed as every remaining system is the park comes back on line . ELLIE is at the keyboard with LEX now , figuring things out , and GRANT is on the phone . GRANT : The children are fine . 133INTCONTROL ROOM DAY HAMMOND is on the phone , MALCOLM is trying to listen . HAMMOND : Thank God . GRANT ( o.s . ) Listen , the phones are back up ! Call the mainland ! Tell them to send the damn helicopters - Suddenly Grant stops in the middle of his sentence . A SCREAM cuts in , then three GUNSHOTS , fast , and a horrible CLUNKING as the phone is dropped . HAMMOND : Grant ! GRANT ! But there 's no answer . 134INTCONTROL ROOMDAY Grant 's rifle lies on the floor , smoking , several spent shells alongside it . The front window of the control room has three huge impact shatter patterns in the glass , where the gunshots hit . TIM goes into an open panel through the ceiling , and into the crawl space . LEX climbs the ladder , followed by ELLIE and GRANT . Grant looks over to the front window , scared as hell , just as - - it SHATTERS in a shower of glass and a raptor EXPLODES into the control room . It lands on its feet on a work station console , images from wall projectors falling across its head . Grant vaults himself up into the ceiling , and knocks the ladder with his feet . The raptor tilts its head curiously , looking up at the swaying ceiling . 135IN THE CRAWL SPACE , Grant , Ellie , and the kids dash across the ceiling panels , moving fast , but carefully , so as not to break through . SMASH ! The raptor 's head bursts through a panel behind them , leaping up at them , SNARLING and SNAPPING . It drops down again , and they keep moving forward . But now it ERUPTS through a panel right in front of them . They SCREAM , its teeth Page 135/139 CLICK just inches in from of Ellie - - - but the raptor ca n't hold itself up there , and it falls back to the floor of the control room . Grant looks around frantically and spots an air duct a few yards away . GRANT : Follow me ! They move for it , but the raptor 's head CRASHES through the ceiling again , this time right underneath Lex . She SCREAMS and is lifted up , on top of its head , and pinned to the ceiling above . Grant SMASHES hit boot into the side of the raptor 's head . The raptor SLAMS at him , latching onto his boot for a second before the raptor 's own weight pulls it back down . Lex goes down with the raptor , spinning into the hole in the ceiling , tumbling down . Grant grabs her by the collar at the last second , but Lex dangles there , above the raptor . The animal flips over onto its feet and crouches to pounce just as Grant summons his strength and jerks Lex back into the ceiling . The raptor springs , but too late . Grant and Lex scramble over to the air duct and join Ellie and Tim inside it . 136IN THE AIR DUCT , Grant , Ellie , and the kids crawl through the air duct as fast at they can , the thin metal BOOMING and creasing around them . They reach a metal gate that shows daylight beneath . Grant reaches out and pulls it up . Through the gate , they can see the lobby of the visitor 's center below . They 're directly above the skeletons of the dinosaurs , the Trex and the sauropod it 's attacking . The unfinished skeletons are surrounded by scaffolding . 137INTROTUNDADAY Grant and the others climb down out of the air duct and onto a platform of the scaffolding that stands alongside the skeletons . They continue down to the second platform , then the third . They suddenly see - A RAPTOR , standing to the side by the second floor railing . It 's much too far to jump to the lobby floor , so Grant climbs gingerly onto the nearest skeleton , the towering brachiosaur . They climb down as fast as they can . Grant helps Tim down , Lex and Ellie follow . Ellie goes to the tail . Lex moves to the front . Grant lands on the main body in the middle with Tim . And the raptor watches them . Up in the ceiling , the skeleton 's anchor bolts GROAN in the Page 136/139 plaster , starting to pull free . But for now , they hold . The raptor flies out and lands on the back of the middle section of the skeleton . SNAP ! It CRACKS apart with the weight , sending the sections spinning in all different directions . Grant and Tim twirl on the middle section . Tim begins to slide down . Grant tries to hold on to him - - but Tim loses his grip and falls to the ground right underneath the swinging , large middle section of the dinosaur skeleton . Meanwhile , Lex spins on the front section . She slips - - and tries to keep from falling as she hangs by her legs . The anchor bolts in the ceiling RIP free , ZINGING past them like bullets . The entire brachiosaur skeleton collapses like a house of cards sending Ellie to the ground . She covers herself with her arms , trying to protect her head from the shower of falling bones . Lex falls , landing on the ground with bones falling on top of her . She SCREAMS . Grant , alone in the middle section , looks up and sees the cable about to SNAP - - he falls ! The large section of the skeleton comes careening down , heading straight for Tim , who lays where he fell on the ground . It comes SMASHING down . . . with just enough space for him to be safe . The raptor tumbles to the floor in a cascade of splintering bone . It lands on its back a few yards away and staggers for a moment , the wind knocked out of it . Grant lands in front of Tim . He stands , and goes to Tim . Lex sits up and sees the raptor regain its feet . She SCREAMS . Ellie stands . She notices the shadows of the second raptor , standing behind the visqueen . She stops dead in her tracks . She backs up towards Grant and Tim . The raptor comes out from under the plastic and looks around . Grant gets Tim out from under the skeleton . Lex joins them . They back away from the raptor , approaching from the left side . They back up towards the large rock in the middle of the room holding the other skeleton . The raptor crouch in their pre-attack stance - The group is caught in the middle of the two approaching raptors . Lex looks back and SCREAMS . Grant and the others continue to back up . They look up and see - - - TYRANNOSAURUS REX ! It 's massive head descends down from above . A set of six-foot jaws clamp down on the raptor . Eighteen-inch teeth sink into its side , and the helpless animal HOWLS in agony as it 's lifted up , up , up off the floor of the lobby . Page 137/139 Grant and the others look up in stunned amazement . They step back behind the rock for safety and look to the right . They see another raptor approaching . The other raptor goes up in the air now , twenty feet off of the lobby floor , held fast in the mouth of the Rex . It stands in the entrance to the lobby in front of the massive hole it ripped through the Visqueen wall . It shakes its enormous head once , BREAKING the neck of the velociraptor , then drops it , dead , to the floor at its feet . Grant , Ellie , and the kids skirt the battle royal on the lobby floor and dash of the door of the Visitor 's Center . The second raptor turns from the humans and lunges at the Rex's side , leaping twelve feet into the air and rending the Rex 's flesh as it comes down , slashing it open with its six-inch claw . The rex BELLOWS in pain , and turns on the raptor , eyes raging , and strikes , just once , quickly , as fast as the head of a serpent . It catches the raptor by thick back end , buts one of its enormous feet down on it , and tears . It rips the last velociraptor in half . The rex whirls around - as it turns , its heavy tail counterbalances , SNAPPING the other way , sweeping across the lobby and SMASHING right through the T-rex skeleton . The skeleton collapses in an explosion of bones , falling to pieces around the living rex . The rex stands majestically in the middle of the lobby , both skeletons swept away , SNAPPING like matchsticks as they settle around the animal . The rex draws itself up to its full height - - - and ROARS . The sound is deafening , and the vibrations rattle the entire Visitor 's Center . The sign which dangled over the lobby by its one remaining wire finally falls , CLATTERING to the floor at the Rex's feet , face up . `` WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH '' , it says . 137AOUTSIDE THE VISITOR 'S CENTER Hammond SQUEALS the Jeep to a halt in front of the steps . Malcolm is lying in the back . Grant and the other practically fall into the Jeep . GRANT : Mr. Hammond , I 've decided not to endorse your Park . HAMMOND : After careful consideration , Dr. Grant - - so have I. Hammond hits the gas and the Jeep takes off . Page 138/139 137B THRUOMITTED : 137C 139EXTHELICOPTER LANDING PADDAY The helicopter rotors whirl to life as the chopper waits on the landing cross . Two Jeeps ROAR up next to it , one driven by GRANT , the other by HAMMOND . INTHELICOPTERDAY One by one , they climb aboard , their faces white from their ordeal . ELLIE comes on first , holding LEX . Then HAMMOND , carrying TIM . And GRANT , helping MALCOLM . No one speaks . Hammond takes another look at his dream , Grant comes over and takes him back to the helicopter . The helicopter takes off immediately . As they rise into the air , they stare out the windows , looking down on the park as it spreads out below . 140DOWN IN THE PARK , the helicopter soars over a vast plain . The Tyrannosaur , which is still feeding on the remains of the dinosaurs it ran down and killed , looks up . It throws its head back and ROARS , waving its little forelimbs at the strange thing in frustration . As the helicopter moves off , the T-rex just stares , silently , with huge , yellowing eyes . It 's a moment of utter bewilderment for the rex , and we almost feel - - - sad for her . 141BACK IN THE HELICOPTER , Hammond looks down at the park , his eyes full . He looks over at the kids . They 're in the back of the helicopter , with Grant . As they look out the window , Grant almost absently has his arms around both kids . Now Ellie looks at him . Both he and the kids seem so natural , so obviously comfortable and trusting with each other . She smiles . The four of them sit that way , in the back of the helicopter , huddled together . Survivors . Grant looks out the window . The helicopter sweeps low over a huge flock of sea birds that's feeding on a school of fish . As the chopper ROARS near , it kicks up the flock . Hundreds of birds sail off in all directions , powerful and graceful . Grant looks at the bids and breaks into a wide grin . The birds reform as flock again and fly straight into the sun . FADE OUT .

Somehow I get the feeling you do n't get out much . - You can tell that ? - Yes . You 're making a mistake . I think you really want to talk to me . Sorry . I have three other interviews before this party is over . But they do n't have something that will change the world . They say they do . Yeah but they 're lying . I 'm not . Are you sick ? No ...

This is the ... ... prototype of those . The first one I had made . It works , but it 's clunky . I call them telepods . They 're controlled by this . Thank God for that . So , what do they do ? The phones booths ? Telepods . Okay , I need an object . Um . Do you have something that is ... ... personal I can use ? Something uniquely you ? An item of clothing or jewelry ? You kidding ? No , I 'm serious . Okay . Here it goes . Mm-hm . - I do n't wear jewelry . - Mm-hm . It 's nice . Brundle , Seth . Watch the stocking . Well ? Great . A giant microwave oven .

Your stocking has just been teleported ... ... from one pod to another . Disintegrated there and reintegrated there . Sort of . It will change the world as we know it , right ? Oh , no .

It 's an old nightclub routine . The two cabinets . You fell for it . - Wait . That was no ... - Are we having lunch ? That was no nightclub routine . I was there . I saw it . Yeah ? Sure . Send him in . You must have made an impression . What do you mean ? Your magician followed you here . I 'm Stathis Borans , editor of Particle Magazine . - Seth Brundle . - I know who you are .

You did n't waste time . I 'm not getting any younger . He was n't impressed by your tape ? He thinks you 're a con man . Excellent . Yeah ? Well , let 's see what the people at Omni think about it . No , no . Listen , Veronica .... I 've come here to say one magic word . Yeah ? Cheeseburger . I 've been working alone too long . I have a strong urge to talk about what I 'm doing . But if this gets out now ... ... Veronica , it 'll kill me . Page 6/27 The Bartok people and my colleagues will kill me . It 's not ready yet . It works okay . No , something important 's missing . Yeah ? Yeah . What ? I can only teleport inanimate objects . What happens when you teleport living things ? Not while we 're eating . Ca n't be worse than this . You 're not doing a good job of convincing me . I think I should tell the world about this now . You should tell it ... ... but not yet . What do you have so far ? Enough to make you nervous . Why not get more ? Make me your major project , a book . Not a magazine article . Follow me and my work , day by day in detail . I have no life , so there 's nothing for you to interfere with .

You gave it to me . I should 've changed the lock . You did n't . - Yeah ? - Yeah . That 's because unconsciously ... ... you still want me to come back , move in again . No .

He 's really quite brilliant . He led the F32 team . Remember that ? An inch away from the Nobel Prize for physics . He was only 20 at the time . I 'm not going to do Brundle . Maybe the Psychology Today gig . That 's not like you . Are you getting out or am I ? I 'll go . Shall I return later and tuck you in ? No . Key . I 'll keep it ... ... for old time 's sake . You 're a petty schmuck . Initiate in 5 seconds . I 've got to do this , Seth . Talk to the tape . Get in the habit . The world will want to know what you 're thinking . `` Fuck '' is what I 'm thinking ! Page 8/27 Good . The world will want to know that . What else ? Why did n't it work ? I think it turned the baboon inside out . Why ? It ca n't deal with the flesh , only inanimate objects . It must be my fault . Why ? Computers only know what you tell them . I do n't know enough about the flesh . I have to learn . I do n't want to talk now . Do you ever change your clothes ? What ? You 're always wearing the same clothes . No , these are clean . I change my clothes every day . Five sets of exactly the same clothes ? Learned it from Einstein . This way I do n't have to ... ... expend any thought on what to wear . I grab the next set on the rack . I bought some steaks . Can I make you one ? We could go out . Cheeseburger ? No , we do n't have to go there . You 're very cute . You know that ? Am I ? Ew . Ow . - What happened ? - On my back . Ow . Oh , God , something 's stuck to your back . Pull it off . Oh , ew . Ow . Sorry . I wondered where this was . Page 9/27 - Do you have any disinfectant ? - No , that 's okay . I 'll kiss it for you . Sorry . I just want to eat you up . That 's why old ladies pinch babies ' cheeks . It 's the flesh . It makes you crazy . Ronnie . Ronnie . You want to try an experiment ? Sure . Eat this . I need an objective opinion . - Yes ? - Well ... ... it could use some finesse , but it tastes like a steak . Okay . Now try this teleported half . - A monkey just came apart in there . - Baboon . Eat . It tastes funny . - Funny how ? - It tastes ... ... synthetic . Mm-hm . What have we proved ? The computer is giving us its interpretation ... ... of a steak . It 's translating it , rethinking it ... ... rather than reproducing it . Something gets lost in the translation . Me . I 'm lost . The flesh . It should make the computer crazy . Like old ladies pinching babies . But it does n't yet . I have n't taught the computer to be made crazy by the flesh . The poetry of the steak . So I 'll teach it now . I knew it . Page 10/27 What are you doing here ? I followed you . Psychology Today , my ass . You stayed with Brundle all night . Why did n't I believe you ? I think he 'd look great in this . Do n't you ? For your Time Magazine cover , you have to look good , right ? Do n't you get it ? I am finally onto something big . - Huge . - Yeah ? What ? His cock ? Crude , Stathis . Very crude . You 're too perfect . You 're a goddess . Thanks for making my paranoid fantasies come true . I do n't have to report to you , you creep . Ronnie ? You have to talk to me . No , I do n't ! We 're finished . I 'll spend the night anywhere I damn well please . Sorry . I 'll take this too . I think it 's time for champagne . Oh , God , Seth . It really happened . You did it ! - You 'll never be carsick again . - Or airsick or seasick . I know . Or tricycle-sick . What 's next ? Send the baboon out for tests , see if he 's okay . How long will that take ? Could be weeks . Really ? Yeah , why ? Well , I was thinking that we could take a holiday . We could ? Yeah . Like an old married couple . Page 11/27 Old man 's got a couple weeks off , so ... ... they go to Florida , someplace warm . Just you and me ? Is there someone else you want to bring along ? No , no , I just .... Is this a romance we 're having ? Yeah . Could be a romance . Come here . I have a great idea . You like Chinese food ? Yes . We 'll have a romantic dinner here . What 's this ? From your editor . It was under the door . Victor , it 's Seth Brundle . Yeah , I 'll wait . What 's that ? Nothing . It 's just personal bullshit . Old married couples share everything to stay old and married . - Listen , Seth , do n't rush it . - What are you talking about ? I have to go out for a few hours . Now ? No , Ronnie , spicy eggplant , champagne . Just a few hours . I have the residue of another life . I have to scrape it off my shoe and get rid of it , once and for all . Hi . What 's this supposed to mean ? I 'm your editor and I 'm shaping your material into a story . You told me there was no story . You said Brundle was a con man . I 've decided to trust your journalistic instincts . Thanks very much . But this is not your story . It 's mine . Page 12/27 Says who ? I sent you to the Bartok party to see what you could find . Your discovery is my discovery . I have a lot of background on Brundle . He 's worked on this for six years . There 's material to find if you dig deep . - I dug . - Stathis .... All transportation is going to become obsolete . And I 'm in the middle of it . - The only inside recorder of the event . - Okay . Okay . Look , just keep me informed . All right ? As a friend ? As a professional confidante ? That 's all ? I do n't want you to disappear from my life . Okay . What about sex ? I 'm not saying love or affection . Just stress-relieving sex . You and me . You 're disgusting . As always . Could n't disappoint you . Residue means your old boyfriend , does n't it ? Stathis Borans is her old boyfriend . `` From the desk of Stathis Borans '' . How about , `` Under the desk of Stathis Borans '' ? She works for her old boyfriend and runs out late at night to see him . Is this the Ronnie game ? I 'm catching on . I 'm catching on . I did n't mean to kill your brother , but he did n't die in vain . I would n't ask you to do anything Page 13/27 that I would n't do myself . You 're all right . I can tell you 're okay . What are we waiting for ? Let 's do it . How you doing ? Now , you tell me . Am I different somehow ? `` Is it live or is it Memorex ? '' It 's too bad Ronnie missed it . I missed you last night . It 's still night . I came back . You had to celebrate without me . I 'm sorry . I went through last night . You went through ? Without testing the baboon ? I was drunk . I was a bit upset . You could 've killed yourself . Are you sleeping with Stathis ? What are you talking about ? I do n't know . I just get that feeling . That 's why you were upset ? I got jealous . Oh , God . Seth , you don't have to be jealous . He 's an old boyfriend . He taught college . I was a science major . He got me started in journalism . Does he love you ? How could he not ? You went through and I was n't there . I taped it for you . You did ? I asked the computer if it improved me , but it did n't understand . That made me think about what I 'm feeling and why . I 'm thinking ... ... that process of being taken apart atom by atom and reassembled ... It 's like filtering coffee . It 's a purifying process . It 's cleansed me . I think it 's going to allow me Page 14/27 to realize ... ... the personal potential I 've been neglecting all these years ... ... that I 've been obsessively pursuing goal after goal . - Do you take coffee with your sugar ? - What ? I 've never given me a chance to be me . Interestingly , when I achieved ... ... what will prove to be my life 's work ... ... I 've become the real me , finally . So , listen ... ... not to wax Messianic ... ... but the synchronicity of the two events may blur the individual effect . But it is , nevertheless , also certainly true . I will say now , however subjectively , human teleportation ... ... molecular breakdown and reformation is inherently purging . It makes a man a king . Since I left the pod , I feel great . I think I will have a cannoli after all . Waiter ! What an accomplishment . But what have I really done ? I 've said to the world : '' Let 's go . Move . Catch me if you can '' . Waiter . Jesus Christ ! Oh , God . Wait . Oh , God . What ? How can you keep going ? You ca n't have any fluid left in your body . We 've been doing this for hours . I 'm not ready to quit yet . Come on . Hey . What 's this ? It 's an attempt to distract me . Page 15/27 Really , what is it ? It 's like ... - ... hairs or something . - I do n't know , it 's .... It happens when you get older , weird hair . They 're really coarse . I 've never been hairy enough . Know what I mean ? Always too boyish . I look forward to a hairy body . It 's one of the compensations of old age . Where are you going ? Not my new hairs . What are you doing ? Relax . You do n't want a body covered with these . God ! They 're really tough ! Listen . I want you to go through . I want to teleport you right now . I hardly need to sleep and I feel wonderful . It 's like a pure , benign drug . The power I feel surging inside me ... ! We 'll be the perfect couple . The dynamic duo . Come on . - Right now . - Hey , wait . Do n't give me that born-again teleportation . I 'm scared . What do I have to say ? I 'm not gon na do it ! You 're a fucking drag , you know ? Something went wrong . When you went through , something went wrong . No ? Not you ? If you 're too chickenshit to be in the dynamic duo club ... ... I 'll find somebody else who can keep up with me . Listen to me ... You 're afraid to dive in the plasma pool . You 're afraid to be destroyed and re-created . Page 16/27 Think you woke me up about the flesh ? You only know society's straight line about the flesh . You ca n't penetrate society's sick gray fear of the flesh . Drink deep , or taste not the plasma spring . See what I 'm saying ? This is not just sex and penetration , but penetration ... ... beyond the veil of the flesh . A deep , penetrating dive into the plasma pool . I 'll have a scotch . Who 's winning ? I do n't know . I hope it 's Marky . - How come ? - Because . I like Marky tonight . I like you tonight . Maybe I 'd better get involved . Hey , pal , you 're disturbing us . $ 100 says I can beat either of you . Take a hike , asshole . Here . Here 's my hundred . I get to take her home if I win . Says who ? Do I look like a hooker ? Tawny , it 's an easy hundred . Let 's get it over with . - Watch out . He eats chocolate bars . - So I noticed . Are you a bodybuilder ? I build bodies . I take them apart and put them back together . Well , you sure took Marky apart . - Let 's go to my place . - Your place ? Well , okay . I live with my mother anyway . But could we go to a few more bars first ? - It 's too early to quit . Page 17/27 - Sure , a few more bars . Great place . There 's no elevator . - I ca n't make it . - There 's an elevator . There , do n't you feel elevated ? Whoa . Wow . Are you a magician ? Yes . So , are we going to breakfast or not ? It 's your turn . - To do what ? - To go through . No . I do n't want to try that . It 'll make you feel sexy . I already feel sexy . How about ... ... a nice ... - ... alcohol rub ? - Do n't do that ! It hurts . Sorry , hon . I did n't know you had the skin of a princess . - You 're sensitive . - Okay ! That 's it . You 're going to like it . - I do n't want to . I 'm afraid . - Do n't be afraid . No . Be afraid . Be very afraid . Who 's this ? Oh , I live with my mother too . Mom , meet Tawny . I got ta go . Thanks for a wonderful time . Why 'd you scare her off ? Jealous ? You 're changing . Everything about you is changing . You look bad . You smell bad . I 've never bathed much . Those weird hairs that grew out of your back , I took them to a lab . Page 18/27 I had them analyzed . The hairs ? The hairs ? Oh , yeah . That 's a strange thing to do . Not as strange as the results . The guy had trouble identifying them . He finally concluded that they were definitely not human . - Very good . - Not human , Seth . In fact , very likely insect hairs . That 's ridiculous . Look . There 's more . Look at your face . Something happened . You need help . You must be sick . You 're jealous ! I 've become free and you ca n't stand it . You 'll do anything to bring me down . Does this look like a sick man to you ? No , stop it ! Can a sick man do that ? The deal is off . I do n't need you anymore . Seth , please , wait . Seth ! Do n't come back . Oh , God .... Oh , no . What 's happening to me ? Am I dying ? Is this how it starts ? Am I dying ? Brundle , Seth . Give me a disc . I need the first teleportation : Run sequence . Hello . Seth . Seth , I 've been trying to reach you . Where are you ? I 've been afraid to see you . Now I 'm afraid not to . Page 19/27 Are you at home ? You don 't know how right you were . I 've gotten ... ... much , much worse . Please come see me . Please come now . Seth ? I 'm here . Stop ! Seth ! You were right . I 'm diseased ... ... and it might be contagious somehow . I would n't want to infect you . And it 's been accelerating . It 's unrelenting . Every day there are changes . Every time I look in the mirror , I 'm someone different , repulsive . What happened ? I know an old lady who swallowed a fly Perhaps she 'll die Seth , please . I was not pure . The teleporter insists on purity . I was not pure . I do n't know what you mean . A fly ... ... got into the transmitter pod with me that first time when I was alone . The computer got confused . There were n't supposed to be two genetic patterns . And it decided to splice us together . It mated us , me and the fly . We had n't been properly introduced . My teleporter turned into a gene splicer . A very good one . I 'm not Seth Brundle anymore . I 'm the offspring of Brundle and a housefly . Oh , God . Oh , God , Seth ! You look so pretty . What will happen ? Page 20/27 I think it 's showing itself as a bizarre form of cancer . General cellular chaos and revolution . I 'm just gon na disintegrate . In a novel way , no doubt . Then I 'll die . - And then it will be over . - No , I do n't accept that . There must be something we can do , someone to go to , tests to be done . No ! I wo n't be just another tumorous bore ... ... talking about his hair falling out and his lost lymph nodes . What do you want me to do ? Why did you call me ? Oh ! Oh . That 's disgusting . My ... ... ear . No ! I 'm scared . Help me . Please , please , help me . - Do n't go back to him . - That 's it ? That 's your advice ? It could be contagious . It could become an epidemic . I have to go back to him . - I do n't believe this . - If you saw him , Stathis .... If you saw how scared and angry and desperate he is ... I 'm sure Typhoid Mary was nice when you saw her socially . - I do not want ... - I do n't care ! All right , fine , okay . Do I have permission to claim your body when this is over ? Oh , God .... Look , how about this ? You say , if only I saw him . Page 21/27 Show me . Tape him . Show me . Let me think about it . I 'll come up with something . Seth ? Seth ? No , no , no . Up here . I 've gotten pretty good at it . Yeah , it 's almost second nature . I stopped biting my nails . Look at this . What 's this ? I do n't know . I seem to be stricken by a disease with a purpose , would n't you say ? Maybe not such a bad disease after all . I ca n't stay . No , no , no . Why not ? Why ca n't you ? I ca n't take it . It 's too much . Why ? The disease has revealed its purpose . We do n't have to worry about contagion . I know what it wants . What does it want ? It wants to turn me into something else . Most people would give anything to be something else . Turned into what ? What do you think , a fly ? Am I becoming a 185-pound fly ? No , I 'm becoming something that never existed . I 'm becoming `` Brundlefly '' . That 's worth a Nobel Prize . Here . I want to give a demonstration ... ... that I think you 'll want to record for posterity . I think you must chronicle ... ... the life and times of Brundlefly , do n't you ? At the very least , it should make Page 22/27 a fabulous children 's book . You seem tired . You got me there ? How does Brundlefly eat ? He found out the hard way that he eats like a fly eats . His teeth are now useless . Although he can chew up solid food , he ca n't digest it . Solid food hurts . So , like a fly ... ... Brundlefly breaks down solids with a corrosive enzyme ... ... playfully called `` vomit drop '' . He regurgitates on his food . It liquefies . And then he sucks it back up . Ready for a demonstration , kids ? Here it goes . Oh , my God . My God ! Hey , Ronnie . Ronnie ! What is it ? I 'm pregnant . Oh , no . Oh , no . I 'm pregnant with Seth 's baby . What do you want to do ? I do n't know . I just .... I do n't know . - Stathis , I 'm scared . - It 's going to be all right , Ronnie . It 's going to be fine . I do n't think I want to lose it . - Why am I losing it ? - It 's better this way . You 'll see . It 's the best thing that could happen . She 's expelling it . I do n't think we 'll have to go in . It 's gon na be easy . Do n't worry , honey . No . Please , no . It 'll be over soon . Here we go . Page 23/27 A little suction here . A little suction . Hold on a minute . There 's more in there . There 's more ? - Yeah , I mean a lot more . Okay . You 're gon na have to help us . Push . Push it out . Come on , push . - That 's it . Come on , push . - No , wait . Give us a push . You can push it out . Come on . No , wait , wait . No . You can do it . Wait . No ! I want a disc . Give me preliminary integration . I want a disc . Give me preliminary integration . You 're relics . Yes , you are . You ca n't deny it . Vestigial , archaeological , redundant . Artifacts of a bygone era . Of historical interest only . You 've missed some good moments . Is that why you 're here ? To catch up ? I wanted .... My teeth have begun to fall out . The medicine cabinet 's now the Brundle Museum of Natural History . Want to see it ? No . Then ... ... what do you want ? I came to tell you .... I just .... I wanted to see you ... ... before .... You have to leave now ... ... and never come back here . Have you heard of insect politics ? Neither have I . Page 24/27 Insects do n't have politics . They 're very brutal . No compassion . No compromise . We ca n't trust the insect . I 'd like to become ... ... the first insect politician . I 'd like to ... ... but I 'm afraid .... I do n't know what you 're trying to say . I 'm saying .... I 'm saying I 'm an insect ... ... who dreamt he was a man and loved it . But now the dream is over ... ... and the insect is awake . No , Seth . I 'm saying ... ... I 'll hurt you if you stay . Let 's go . Let 's do it now . Now ? Wait . Wait a minute . What did he say ? I could n't tell him . Let 's go , damn it . No ! I think we should wait a few days . You 're not in the right state of mind . I want it out of my body now . You should have seen him . There could be anything in here , in me , in my body . I do n't know if I can arrange it now , tonight . Why do we have to ... ? I do n't want it . Understand ? I do n't want it in my body ! Well , okay , what 's the story ? She 's pregnant and she wants an abortion . In the middle of the night ? We have good reason to think that ... ... this child will be deformed . Page 25/27 - Yeah , but in the middle of the night ? - Look , Brent . Please . Is it your child ? No . It 's the child of a man who is deformed . I do n't mean to interfere ... ... but I detect a certain uncertainty here . There are tests we can do to determine whether ... I do n't want tests . Tests ca n't guarantee anything . The baby could start off normal , then become .... I want an abortion . I 'll do it myself if I have to . If you 'll slip into that , we 'll be on our way in no time . No . Wait , Seth , no . Why did you want to kill Brundle ? The baby might be all that 's left of the real me . Please do n't kill me . I ca n't have it . I 'm afraid . Please , have the baby . I ca n't . I ca n't . Too bad . Too bad . Jesus ! Ah ! No , do n't . Do n't , please . Please . Help me . Help me be human . How ? Well .... I go there ... ... and you go there . We come apart ... ... and then we come together there . Page 26/27 You , me and the baby . Together . No .... We 'll be the ultimate family . A family of three , joined together in one body . More human than I am alone . No , no ! Oh , God . Please ! Oh , God , please ! No , I ca n't . I ca n't . No . Oh , God ! Page 27/27
2015;Scripts.com The Man Who Knew Infinity By Matt Brown Page 1/41 1 HARDY : as I have never really formed before , and try to help you to form some sort of reasoned estimate of the most romantic figure in the recent history of mathematics . Ramanujan was an Indian , and I suppose that it is always a little difficult for an Englishman and an Indian to understand one another properly . I owe more to him than to anyone else in the world , and my association with him is the one romantic incident of my life . ( BELL TOLLS ) ( ELEPHANT TRUMPETING ) He was , in a way , my discovery . I did not invent him . Like other great men , he invented himself . The difficulty for me , then , is not that I do not know enough about him , but that I know and feel too much . ( BELL RINGS ) ( RAIN POURING ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) You can also see I 've been conducting my own mathematical researches . MAN : You 're unemployable . I 'll write you a recommendation . Maybe someone ... With all due respect , sir , I have recommendations . What I need is a job . Please . I have a wife . You people are all the same . Now get out . Now ! I 'm doomed , like Galileo . He died in poverty , you know . Page 2/41 ( CHUCKLES ) At least you hold yourself in good esteem . Whatever is written in your fate will happen . You ca n't change that . My fate is to have a wife who lives with my mother while I sleep here with you all because the British think I 'm a raving lunatic . ( CHUCKLES ) As do we Indians . ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) MAN : RAMANUJAN : - How many do you have ? - None . - Who else have you shown this to ? - Everyone . The British . The Indians . They all send me to someone else . I can offer you a job , but your evenings will have to be spent in helping me understand this . A job ? - Do we have an agreement ? - Yes . - Most certainly , sir . - Good . Send for your wife so you can be together . And put this on . Follow me . Sir Francis , here are today 's ledgers . And our new clerk . Narayana , how long have you worked for me ? Since I helped to design the bridge on the Godavari , which now requires me to call you `` Sir '' . Sir Francis . This man looks as if he lives on the streets . - Get him out of here . Page 3/41 - RAMANUJAN : Forgive my appearance , but I really am quite exceptional with numbers . What you might see now is ordinary glass , I promise you will soon remain to see a diamond . Well ... ( EXHALES ) Your accounts had better be half as polished as your ego . ( CATTLE LOWING ) RAMANUJAN : It 's the best I could do for now . It 's a home . Please . Where is the kitchen ? RAMANUJAN : Ah ! ( CHUCKLES ) From the wedding . Do n't worry . I will sleep on the floor . I 'm used to it . I have to go back to work now . NARAYANA : It was faster in my head . ( ABACUS CLICKING ) Impressive . If Sir Francis comes here , at least pretend to use this . Hmm . I see you 've been working on your own formulas . Paper is a precious commodity here . You 'll find plenty of packing down at the docks . Thank you , sir . See you tonight . NARAYANA : we need to seek an audience with someone who really Page 4/41 understands all this . I 've been to everyone in Madras . ( SCOFFS ) Madras . Did you know that the name derives from Mandarajya ? `` The realm of the stupid . '' There 's a whole world out there . And there 's England . You do n't come home . It is I who owe the apology for keeping him . I think it's enough for tonight , Ramanujan . I 'm sorry . I was told you love numbers more than people . Some . Not you . Perhaps we can start over . I am Ramanujan . And I am your wife . Go ahead . You can look . Please . What does it all do ? It 's like a painting , I think . Only imagine it is with colors you can not see . ( SNIGGERS ) What good is that ? ( CHUCKLES ) Not much for you , I 'm afraid . But for me it is everything . Maybe there is someone else who can see and understand it as well . And for them it will be important . Have you met them ? No . Not yet . I want to understand more than just colors I ca n't see . What do you see ? - Sand . - Yes . Imagine , if we could Page 5/41 look so closely , we could see each grain , each particle . You see , there are ... There are patterns in everything . The color in light . The reflections on water . In maths , these patterns reveal themselves in the most incredible form . It 's quite beautiful . ( DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ) You should sleep in the bed . - Amma . - Hmm ? I have made a friend in my boss . He 's going to find somebody to understand my work outside Madras . Outside India . That is an honor . What nonsense are you talking ? Amma , he sees something in me . He surely sees enough of you . You 're never here at home . ( specks Tamil ) It is forbidden to cross the seas . NARAYANA : Ramanujan , listen to me . This work is too important to die with you . It must be published . If you , an Indian , are at the pinnacle with these formulas , then the British , even while they subjugate us , must recognize that our brightest matches theirs . Anna , please . I ca n't . You have been alone in your mind your whole life . Now other people have the chance to understand you . Not just your Namagiri . Imagine . Page 6/41 All I do is imagine . NARAYANA : Baker . Hobson . And who 's this ? Oh , that 's , er ... That 's Hardy . He 's a real pot stirrer . You know , he single-handedly reformed the entire Tripos examination system . Turned over hundreds of years of history . He 's your man . Trinity , eh ? Kings , prime ministers . Isaac Newton . Byron . Now perhaps even you . ( SIR FRANCIS CHUCKLES ) ( BELL TOLLING ) Hmm . Trouble on the Continent ? There will be . We beat the Frogs by a goal at Twickenham . I meant in the Balkans . Ah , the Balkans . You 've got one there seems particularly well traveled . MAN : HARDY : '' I beg to introduce myself as a clerk in the Accounts Department . '' - What this time ? - Quite impressive , really . Someone 's gone to a lot of trouble . A Hindu clerk ! And who claims he can give meaning to the negative values of the gamma function . - Littlewood ? - Without doubt . ( SCOFFS ) You know , Littlewood , this year alone , Page 7/41 I 've received correspondence from those who profess to prove the prophetic wisdom of the Pyramids , the revelations of the Elders of Zion , and the cryptograms , which Bacon supposedly buried within the plays of the so-called Shakespeare . But a letter from an ill-educated Indian clerk in Madras , challenging assertions I made in the tracts series , really takes the biscuit . Well , I have to say , I 've made similar assertions myself . So you admit it ? But this was three years ago . No , no , no . I 'm talking about the letter . Bloody brilliant , I thought . I do n't know where you got the postmark . Almost had me fooled . ( STUTTERING ) I simply do n't know what you 're talking about . Oh , come on . I 'm not a complete idiot . I do n't know how to get this into your thick skull , but whatever it is you 're talking about , I 'm simply not involved . Play . Sir . You 've missed Hall . Not hungry . ( SIGHS ) I tell you , there is a war coming , no doubt about it . Because we are being led like mindless , spineless sheep and no one bothers to question any of it . It 's coming , all right . You can smell it . You 're as paranoid as Hardy . ( SCOFFS ) With all due respect , Bertie , you could n't hold a candle . Littlewood , could I have a word ? Page 8/41 Yes , of course . LITTLEWOOD : Infinite series . God knows what else . Oh , excuse me . I always forget you do n't believe in a supreme being . Right . If this chap turns out to be genuine , you might have to reconsider . He must be genuine . Who would have the imagination to invent all that ? Well , I 'm rather flattered you thought I did . ( LAUGHS ) These two infinite series are the more intriguing . Yeah . They defeated me completely . I 've never seen anything like them . Well , it 's deceptive . I 'll wager the hypergeometric series . Ha ! Our great Littlewood , stumped . He 's Hobbs class , I 'd say . `` Being inexperienced , '' I would very highly value any advice you give me . `` Yours truly , S . Ramanujan . '' What does the `` S '' stand for ? You can ask him yourself . You intend to invite him here ? Well , no , no , no , no , no . Much better , let him rot away in his office in Madras , hmm ? - Hmm ? - Ah , Mr. Ramanujan . There seems to be a letter for you . Postmarked England . Cambridge , England . From a Mr. G. H. Hardy . I used to come here and watch the boats leaving . I always wondered what it would be like to be on one of them . Page 9/41 I 'm finally here and you talk of crossing the sea ? It is forbidden for us . I do n't understand . If you go , it will never be the same . This is not Calcutta or Bombay . No one will marry our children . No one will even talk to us ! Then we will move to Calcutta or Bombay . Besides , I do n't want to talk to anyone but you . Do you promise to bring me as soon as you are able ? Yes . Then that is what we will do . JANAKI : Cut it . ( PRAYS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ) ( MOTHER PRAYING SOFTLY IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ) ( SIGHS ) You cut your hair . What have you done ? Amma , I 've decided to go to England . Did you ? Or did she convince you ? So that both of you could run away together ? Huh ? This is all her doing . She wants you all to herself . ( MUTTERS SOFTLY ) ( LIVELY CHATTER OF CHILDREN ) ( SHIP HORN BLARES ) Please look after each other while I 'm gone . Never forget your prayers . You can not pollute yourself with their food , if you ever want to come back . Do n't forget me . I could never . I promise . ( SOBBING ) Well , off we go . Page 10/41 6,000 miles . Can you imagine ? I 've known larger numbers . Do n't let it ruin your big day with Gunga Din . I 'm sure it wo n't mean war . ( SCOFFS ) All this Din , Din , Din . Are you Ramanujan , by chance ? - Very much by chance . - Ah . - Hello . Sorry . - Oh . ( CHUCKLES ) John Littlewood . Such a pleasure . I was just on my way to meet you . Well , shall we go together ? Yes . The intended effect . Do n't be intimidated . Great knowledge often comes from the humblest of origins . Come along . You see that sapling ? That 's the very tree under which Newton sat , when the apple dropped on his head and he invented gravity . ( CHUCKLES ) This way . We 've been anticipating your arrival for some time . MAN : I mean , we bring these Indians over at great expense and look what happens . Yeah , well , it 's not just that this chap is Ramjin , whatever his name is , is Indian . After all , we do have Indian students here . Just not ones with no education to speak of . It 's a disgrace . Ramanujan is a special case . Uh , why is that , exactly ? We 've all read his letter . There are no proofs . Page 11/41 Are we just supposed to take him at his word ? No . You 're to take him at mine . Change , gentlemen . It 's a wonderful thing . Embrace it . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Take it as a sign of respect to quieten this lot . Is Mr. Hardy here ? I 'm most excited to meet him . He must be a very kind man to bring me all this way . Mmm . Ah . Speak of the devil . Hello . I 'm Hardy . Welcome to Trinity , Mr. Ramanujan . Am I pronouncing that properly ? Yes , sir . Perfectly . It 's an honor , sir . Thank you . I very much look forward to beginning our work . So , tomorrow , 10:00 , my rooms . I look forward to it . Did I say something wrong ? Do n't worry . I 'll look out for you . That 's if you believe he actually exists . You see , there's speculation that Mr. Littlewood here is merely a figment of Hardy 's imagination . If he ever makes a mistake , he'll have someone else to blame . Ramanujan , Bertrand Russell . Welcome to our little asylum . Hello . Come along , come along . ( BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE ) ( BLOWING ) Page 12/41 MAN : It 's for Fellows only ! Excuse me , sir . Could you direct me to New Court ? - To Mr. Hardy ? - Through there . You have something on your forehead . Oh . Thank you . The shoes , they hurt my feet . ( CLEARS THROAT ) LITTLEWOOD : You see , you do exist . Yes . Right . Ramanujan , we 've decided that for the good of everybody you should attend some lectures . But I 'm here to publish . Yes . All in good time , I hope . But first we need proofs of your work . It 's really nothing to worry about . It 's simply a question of acquainting you with the more formal methods that will benefit our future work together . I mean , we need a common language . You would n't expect us to converse with you in Tamil . ( SNIGGERS ) No . But you expect me to speak English . Quite . So , there will be plenty of time for publishing . I 'm sorry , but with all humility , how does anyone know that ? I do n't want this to die with me . ( LAUGHS ) I assure you it wo n't . Thank you , sir . But I have much more to share with you . As I told you , the letter only contained a small sampling of my discoveries . You 'll see I have even found a function which exactly represents the number Page 13/41 of prime numbers less than X in the form of an infinite series . - Exactly ? - Yes . I thought if we were going to publish , it should be something , uh , ground-breaking . This is most unexpected . ( CHUCKLES ) Hardy . ( STUTTERING ) This will take a lifetime . Maybe two . ( CHATTER AND LAUGHTER OUTSIDE ) ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) It 's quite alarming to see you so thoroughly pleased with yourself . Ca n't have anything to do with these notebooks , can it ? ( CHUCKLES ) You could spend the rest of your life trying to prove half of it and never have another original idea of your own . Bertie . If I could prove , by logic , that you are gon na die in five minutes , I 'd be sorry , but my sorrow would be very much mitigated by the pleasure in the proof . Might get your wish granted with half the Continent up in flames and old men like that running the show . ( HARDY GRUNTS ) No . No , you 're just a bit sore because you 're worried he 'll be up there before you are . Hmm , I doubt a dark face will ever grace these walls , let alone become a Fellow . Hmm . Ramanujan ! Over here ! Come over , sit with us . Welcome to Hall . - I 'm Chandra Mahalanobis . Page 14/41 - Hello . And this is Andrew Hartley . I am Ramanujan . Well , everyone knows who you are , mate . Word 's out you've taken on the prime number theorem . It is quite extraordinary , them bringing you here like this . Such an honor . There are other Indians ? A few . You 're from the South ? Calcutta myself . This must be quite a shock for you . ( CHUCKLES ) Truth is , you 've more in common than you think . His father was a schoolteacher . Not exactly Trinity stock . Hardy 's earned it on his own merits . It 's probably why he 's taken to you . Does he have a wife ? No . He 's married to his work , as they say . I suppose that means you now . Stop . He 's a vegetarian . MAN : Potatoes , sir . How 's that any better ? The potatoes are cooked in lard . - I 'm so sorry . - Not at all . But ... But I think I will go . I hope to see you soon . ( DOOR OPENS ) Ramanujan . Did you have a good dinner ? They make a fine mutton . Yes , sir . Delicious . And your ... Your rooms ? Satisfactory ? I want everything to be to your advantage so that we can Page 15/41 be as productive as possible . Thank you , sir . Very nice paper . Well ... Use it wisely . Well , I 'll say good night , then . All right . Now ... You . Are you following this ? Yes , sir . Most excitedly . But you don't appear to be taking any notes . Is there something you 'd like to contribute ? Well , come on , then . Come on ! You 'll need the chalk . But I ... I had n't completed that proof . How do you know ? I do n't know . I just do . Well , gentlemen , it appears that our time is up . Thank you for your attention . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Not you . Little wog , let me tell you something . You do n't pull a stunt like that in my class . You do n't belong here and you can tell your Master Hardy I said as much ! Now , get out ! ( CHATTER AND LAUGHTER ) ( CLOCK TICKING ) My sacred thread . It 's to help ward off evil spirits . How did it work with Mr. Howard ? I 'm sorry , sir . I got too excited . Not a word often associated with his lectures . How did you know that theorem ? It came to me . ( CHUCKLES ) Mr. Hardy , I do n't understand why we waste our time Page 16/41 doing all these proofs . I have the formulas . It 's not that I ca n't see what you 've claimed . It 's that I 'm not sure that you know how you got there or , indeed , that your claims are correct . There are subtleties which ... But they are right , sir . I have more important new ideas . Yes , but intuition is not enough . It has to be held accountable . And a little humility would go a long way . Why do you think they want us to fail ? Because I am Indian . Well , yeah , there is that . But also because of what we represent . Now , Euler and Jacobi . Who are they ? Mathematicians . Just names to you . Euler was the most productive mathematician of the 18th century . Most of his work done after he was blind . Jacobi , like you , was snatched from obscurity , and was almost as impressive as Euler . Now , I think you are in their class . What they had in common , what I see in you , is a love of form . It 's all through your notebooks . Let me ask you something . Why do you do it , any of this ? Because I have to . I see it . Like Euler . Form for its own sake . An art unto itself . And , like all art , it reflects truth . It 's the only truth I know . It 's my church . And you , just as Mozart could hear an entire symphony in his head , you dance with numbers to infinity . ( CHUCKLES ) But this dance , this art , does little to endear us Page 17/41 to certain factions who see us as mere conjurors . So if we are going to challenge areas of mathematics that are so well trod , we can not afford to be wrong . I need you to attend your lectures , do n't offend your professors , and keep doing your proofs , otherwise this experiment of ours will be doomed to failure . Come with me . I wan na show you something . There are many ways to be honored in life . For us , being elected a Fellow is certainly one , but in my humble opinion to leave a legacy , here at the Wren after we 're gone is the greatest . This library houses the Epistles of Saint Paul , the poems of Milton , Morgan 's Bible . ( INHALES DEEPLY ) But in my estimation , as a man of numbers , the pice de rsistance is Newton 's Principia Mathematica . Now , just as Newton represents the physical aspect of our work , your notebooks represent the abstract . Took a long time for Newton to be proved . Which is why we have an obligation to prove these . And if we do , I believe that one day ... ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) One day these notebooks will find their place here . Now , do you understand what 's at stake here ? Good . JANAKI : Page 18/41 you are taking care of yourself and that Mr. Hardy is good to you . Everyone here is so proud of you . But most proud of all is me . I spend every day missing you , and waiting for your letter to tell me I 'm coming to be with you across the ocean . You are my everything . ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) I 've discovered a new series . Look , I 'm not interested in a new series . I thought I 'd explained this . I need your proofs . We had an agreement . Just , please , look at it , sir . It is true . How do you know that ? Because it is written . Written where , Ramanujan ? Hmm ? ( SIGHS ) Now , take my coat , go home and get properly dressed before you freeze . Sir , I 've come a very long way to be here . And you promised to help me publish . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Do n't look at me like that . It 's for his own good . You would n't think he 's so bloody smart by the way he dresses . Huh . MAN : Partitions . No , no , no , wait . This even you could understand . P of 4 equals 5 . Now , all that means is there are five ways to add up the number 4 . 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 , 3 + 1 , 2 + 1 + 1 , Page 19/41 2 + 2 , and 4 . Seems simple enough . Yeah . So it does . But when you raise the number of P to 100 , there are 204,226 different combinations . ( CHUCKLES ) Major MacMahon did it by hand . Took him weeks . And now he thinks he can figure out a formula . Plug in the number , any number , and out comes the number of partitions . Like magic . I take it you have tried to crack this one before ? It 's considered impossible . Unsolvable . A bloody rabbit hole mystery of the universe . Until now ? `` Din ! Din ! Din ! Gunga Din . '' So , um ... Using the divergence theorem , what is the flux of F through S here ? ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) What on earth 's he doing ? - Proofs . Yeah . - Proofs ? You should let him run , Hardy . You should n't stifle him . He 's gone to the cricket . Just , uh , follow the umbrella . Sir ! Mr. Hardy ! Mr. Hardy . Oh , I 've been over those proofs of yours , if you can call them that , very carefully . And I 've marked where you 're missing steps and where you 've made mistakes . There 's much more I could say , but that 's where you should begin . Listen , I 'm hard on you Page 20/41 for your own benefit . So that you can be published . But , sir , you can publish the notebooks and my prime number theorem . You 've had them since I arrived . There is nothing I 'd like more . But , if I was to publish them in their present state , I 'd be sent to the lunatic asylum . You do n't understand . These ... I do n't think about this the same way you do . These steps you want , what you want , I do not know how to do . Well , you can just begin by trying your best and see if you do n't surprise yourself . Sir , do you know something I do n't ? Apparently not . Oh , no , God and I do n't see exactly eye to eye . So if I prepare for rain , then it wo n't . So far , so good . I 'm Hardy and I 'm spending the afternoon in the Wren Library . Now we 're sure to have sunshine . ( CHUCKLES ) You see , I 'm what you call an atheist . No , sir . You believe in God . You just do n't think He likes you . Oh , really ? Listen ... I was n't gon na ... Give you this just yet , but I took the liberty of doing some of your proofs myself . Just to show you what together we can achieve . See ? You 've been published . Mr. Hardy , thank you ! Thank you , sir ! ( LOW CHATTER ) It is with great pride Page 21/41 that today all of us have shared the publication of my son 's article in the London Mathematical Society . ( APPLAUSE ) Such a big thing . A very prestigious society . ( SPEAKS TAMIL ) So how really is the little genius ? Do n't pay attention to her . She 's not proud enough of his achievements . Huh ? ( SPEAKS TAMIL AND LAUGHS ) ( KNOCKING ) - ( KNOCKING ) - MAN : Wake up . It just came over the wire . We 're at war . - Here ? - No , silly , Belgium . Now , come on ! The King 's arriving ! MEN : Bloody jingoes . Bertie 's asked me to help him with his Union of Democratic Control or something . Hmm , agitating already ? Well ... Well , I received a letter from the War Office this morning . Seems they need some assistance with ballistics . - Ballistics ? You ? - I know . I did try to explain , but they 're rather a dense lot . - Yeah . - Anyway , you probably wo n't miss me . There 's an ongoing theory that I'm merely a figment of your imagination . ( CHUCKLES ) That 's not true . ( MEN CHANTING ) Ah , Ramanujan 's out there . Page 22/41 There 's a reason he does n't like proofs , you know . They may be disagreeable to his formulas . MEN : How do you mean ? Well , I 've been having some reservations about some of his work . Oh . Well , what did you expect ? He may belong to a world beyond us , but he 's not God . Well , that 's a relief . He 's not . How will Janaki ever come now ? Do n't worry . They say it 'll be over by Christmas . Please finish by telling him that , of course , I will come and not to worry about the war . It is far away from here . And that I will wait for him to make the necessary arrangements . Also that I love him very much . That is all . ( CHICKEN CACKLING ) Make your mark here . I knew your husband . But he spent all the time at the temple . He 's still there in the alcove . ( GRATING ) JANAKI : Amma , please , would you post this for him ? Hmm ? He needs to know I will still come with the war . Amma , please let me help you . ( PATIENT CRIES OUT IN PAIN ) Where are all the vegetables ? Rationing for the war . - And some ... Thank you . - Hmm . Page 23/41 WOMAN : Please , can you check again ? I already looked again . Now , you 're holding up the queue . - His mum forgot to write him . - ( LAUGHS ) Look who it is , the genius wog ! Can you believe they send us off while he kips here in luxury ? Oi ! Where do you think you 're going ? You freeloading little blackie . Hey . Hey . I 'm talking to you . Hey . ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) This is our home . Do n't you forget it . ( LAUGHING ) ( WHIMPERS ) ( APPLAUSE ) Victory at any price ? Victory for whom ? ( CROWD MUTTERING IN AGREEMENT ) I understand it 's inevitable that anybody primarily interested in peace should be unpopular in a time of war . But perhaps that is all the more reason that we should exist . - ( APPLAUSE ) - ALL : Mr. Littlewood has very kindly offered us his rooms while he is away solving the intricacies of ballistics for which he is so ill-suited . ( ALL LAUGH ) So please keep your hands off my books . By that he means his whiskey collection . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Thank you all very much for coming . - Bless you . - ( APPLAUSE ) Page 24/41 Thank you so much . Thank you for coming . ( BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE ) Bloody cheek ! ... were so fast and ours were in completely the wrong position . What is the meaning of this ? I 'd have thought you 'd choose your battles more wisely . After all , it 's only the goodwill of the college that allows Ramujin here . What the bloody hell does the UDC have to do with Ramanujan ? You should know that your friend , Russell , is going to lose his lectureship as a result of the leaflets he 's been distributing . We have heard that others are doing the same . Are you threatening me ? Mr. Howard is simply trying to enlighten you as to the precariousness of your situation . You are perfectly at liberty to take the matter to the College Council . Well , rest assured , I shall , on principle . Well , that 's a rather dangerous word , with all your liberal colleagues in France . Change , Hardy . That 's what you wanted . Now you get used to it . From Mr. Littlewood , sir . If I may , he 's so misplaced on a battlefield , I should n't think a bullet would recognize him as a target . Hmm . ( ENVELOPE TEARING ) ( DOOR SHUTS ) Damn you , Littlewood . LITTLEWOOD : please forgive this personal transgression . I 'm gone now to this god-awful war Page 25/41 and have n't the faintest idea if I will ever return . Fortunately , unlike you , I do have God to take comfort in . I have two points to make . The first is that Ramanujan 's work on primes , while brilliant in itself , is actually wrong . The other point is less straightforward . You have in Ramanujan nothing short of a miracle . The man exceeds any notion of brilliance that I have ever understood . Forget Jacobi , we can compare him with Newton . I have come to believe that for Ramanujan , every single positive integer is one of his personal friends . And , to that end , you , too , have a responsibility . You have to look after him and make sure that his work amounts to something . Do n't let Howard and his lot win . So , you see , Hardy , you , too , have a war to fight . Just do n't let it be with Ramanujan . So , there you have it . He left this for you to see for yourself . Your theorem on primes is wrong . It 's not . It ca n't be . It 's rather interesting , really . If you compare the prime number approximation with the actual number of primes , the calculation tells us what ? It always moves higher . Even at a thousand ? A million ? A billion trillion ? Yes ? Where is the proof ? I gave it to you . It proves it . No , because Page 26/41 however intuitively obvious it may seem , when subject to calculation , it fails . Mr. Littlewood has calculated a number and it shows that your theorem will sometimes predict less , not more , than the actual number of primes . Your theorem is wrong . And this is why we can not publish anymore until you finally trust me on this business of proofs . Intuition can only carry you so far . Stop ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) I ... I ca n't hear this anymore . Intuition ? You say this word as if it is nothing . Is that all it is to you ? All that I am ? Look , I 'm sorry . Am I ... I 'm missing something . ( BREATHING SHARPLY ) You 've ... You 've never even seen me , let alone know me . You ... You are a man of no faith ! I do n't see pictures of anyone here ! Not even family ! Who are you , Mr. Hardy ? How dare you ... How dare you judge me ? But it is you who does of me ! Do n't you see ? No . Quite frankly , I do n't ! Do n't you know what I 've given up to be here ? I have nothing . Do you even see the bruises on my face ? I have a wife , Mr. Hardy . ( CRIES OF PAIN ) ( BIRDSONG ) ( CLATTERING AT DOOR ) Ah . At last . Ramanujan ? Is that you ? Mr. Hardy . Page 27/41 You 're not well ? Nothing serious . Sure ? Oh . I 'm just off to the Wren . Believe it or not , if you can find your way round the beds , there are still some books there . Those proofs you left ... Wonderful . Really wonderful . So , we start work again ? Tomorrow morning ? - Yes , sir . - Good . ( GROANS SOFTLY ) ( BELLS TOLLING ) My regards to your fine wife . Thank you so much . Good day , gentlemen . I 'm very sorry , sir . He was a fine young man . Best ... Best of his year . They were all fine young men . All the knowledge they gained here . Sacrificed for a few yards of land . They say it 's the price of victory . Hmm ? Come , Bertie . I 'm worried about Ramanujan . Why ? Well , he does n't seem quite himself . What would you know about that ? Very little , I admit . But I do n't think he 's well . He seems to have changed . We had a terrible row the other night about intuition , of all things , and he stormed out . And then a day later he produces these wonderful proofs . Well , Harold , you 've got your way . How do you mean ? You and your damned rigor has finally broken his spirits . Page 28/41 I warned you to let him run . Yeah , well , he 's not a bloody racehorse . No , he 's not . But as you 've hardly treated him as a human being , I suppose ... Well , I suppose a horse is n't a bad place to start . Major , can I have a word ? I do n't have time for you ! Partitions ! It 's Ramanujan . The gall . The unbridled arrogance . He wo n't be able to do it without you . He wo n't be able to do it at all . ( SHIVERING ) ( COUGHING ) I 've been going over your work on partitions . Seems to me you're on the verge of a major breakthrough . So now you've begun to embrace some proper rigor ... I think you should meet Major MacMahon . He 's the leader in combinatorics at the University and ... Also happens to be one of your most vocal opponents . He says partitions ca n't be done . Especially by the likes of you . Then he better start counting very high . ( KNOCKING ) MACMAHON : Ah . I 've been waiting for you . Square root of 58,639 ? Now ! 242 what ? Point 1549090 . Yes , child 's play . Try me . ( LAUGHS ) Go on . Same number squared . 3,438,532,321 . - Ha ! Thrashed ya ! Page 29/41 - ( CHUCKLES ) Combinatorics , that 's what I do . Glorified dice throwing . ( SIGHS ) Bloody nerve of you both . You fail on primes , then you think you can just turn round and crack partitions ? Ca n't be done , I 'm telling you . Especially not by you . It can . And I will . No , I will . By hand . By slow and painful addition , and then you can be absolutely certain that whatever formula you two can dream up will be quite wrong . Then you can crawl back under whatever rock you came from in India and we can put to bed this charade of yours , Hardy . Now , how high do I have to go ? P of 200 should do . I really can do it . Well , here we are , P of 200 . The moment of truth . You know , I was stationed in Madras once . Yeah . Well , you first . What has your formula given you ? 3,972,998,000,000 . My God . You 're close . Within 2 % . Well , I 'll be damned . Major MacMahon , may I introduce you to Mr. Ramanujan . ( COUGHS ) ( GROANS ) - ( GRUNTS ) - How long ? Three weeks . Mmm-hmm . And the fever ? Page 30/41 - Longer . - Breathe in . ( INHALES ) Breathe in . Well , it 's not good . You 've all the early signs of tubercula . I 'm sorry . You 're a breeding ground for infection . I 'm so sorry , Ramanujan . Hardy can never know . BOY : ( CROWD CLAMORING ) It 's a zeppelin ! - ( BOMB WHIZZES PAST ) - Come on , Ram ! ( SCREAMING ) - Over here ! - ( BOMB WHIZZES PAST ) ( SHOUTING ) ( EXPLOSIONS ) I 'm being punished . It 's just the fever . ( SIGHS ) ( SINGS SOFTLY ) Has he wrote yet ? No . Where are you going ? ( BELL TOLLS ) ( SOBS ) You forgot me . ( SOBBING ) You see , you were right . Cauchy 's theorem will work . It 's just leading to the circle concept . At 2,000 , it should bring it down to ... Less than 1 % or so . And as N goes to infinity ... The error goes to zero . You see ? You 're beginning to see the nuances and complexities , which you were only catching at a glance before . What an unlikely team we make . Page 31/41 If we really crack partitions , this will be a monumental breakthrough . ( SIGHS ) Did I tell you I 've ... I 've put you up for a Fellowship ? Mr. Hardy , thank you . ( COUGHS ) Are you getting enough to eat ? I mean , I know there are shortages , but there 's still plenty of good grub in Hall . I 'm all right . It 's nothing . Let me ask you something . How does all this come to you ? I do n't know . Why am I bothering with a Council meeting when I 'm getting the boot ? If you think I 'm gon na have that charlatan for a Fellow , you 're very much mistaken . Oh , please tell me you did n't propose him . - He 's gon na crack partitions . - Oh . He 's worthy . You 're the one who told me to let him run like a damn horse . Well , I did . And now I ... I need to raise his spirits . You mean you need to relieve your own guilt . Really , for someone so clever , you can be so terribly dim . So , in the matter of Fellowship for Srinivasa Ramanujan , we call the matter to vote . I 'm sorry to bother you so late . I felt I should be the one to tell you . I 'm very embarrassed , for myself and for the College . But your Fellowship was denied . Thank you for telling me . I know you did all you could .

( BELL TOLLING IN BACKGROUND ) NURSE : This gentleman's looking for the Indian student . Ah , yes . He came in last night . Not right in the head . Terrible fever . He was here . ( COUGHS ) Page 33/41 DOCTOR : You may not have long . You should set your affairs in order . Do you have any family here ? Anyone ? ( BREATHING GETS FASTER ) ( TRAIN APPROACHES ) ( TRAIN BRAKES SQUEAL ) MAN : ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) Sir , something 's happened in London . Call me a taxi , will you ? DOCTOR : The conductor saw him before he jumped . The danger is his lungs . Yes , he 's had a bad cough for some time . It is no cough . He has advanced tuberculosis . Well , is ... Is there nothing we could do ? Pray . It will take a miracle . RAMANUJAN : I 'm sorry for the trouble I 've caused you . Gave me quite a scare . Self-prophesying . My wife has forgotten me . I have no one . I understand that you might feel like that , but ... You should have told me . I could have helped . ( WIND WHISTLING ) You know , it just as easily could have been me . Well , I 'm glad it was n't . You have cause enough with Ramanujan . ( CHUCKLES ) I 'll be thinking of you both . Where will you go ? Oh , I 'll go down the road to Oxford . And I 'll wait for Page 34/41 them to beg to have me back here . Hmm . Good-bye , Harold . Bye , Bertie . Too bad he could n't take Hardy with him . I still do n't see what he bloody contributes . Yeah , I had words with Major MacMahon . It seems that Ramanujan 's on the verge of a major breakthrough . That 's right . Partitions . Oh , that 's impossible . Hmm . Remains to be seen . ( SNIFFS ) God , it 's freezing in here . Are you warm enough ? Try sleeping . I have to go to that pipe just so I do n't freeze . It would have been better for all had the train done its job . Oh , yeah , you could have been reincarnated as a pigeon turd . ( BOTH LAUGH ) Sorry I 've not been able to be a better friend to you in the traditional sense . I know you 've needed one , but I 'm not very good at all of that . I never have been . Life for me is ... It 's always been mathematics . You wanted to know how I get my ideas . Mmm . My God . Namagiri . She speaks to me . Puts formulas on my tongue when I sleep , sometimes when I pray . Do you believe me ? Because if you are my friend , then you will know that I 'm telling you the truth . If you are truly my friend . But I do n't believe in God . I do n't believe in anything I ca n't prove . Page 35/41 Then you ca n't believe in me . Do n't you see ? An equation has no meaning to me unless it expresses a thought of God . Maybe it is better that we just remain what we were . When I was at school , I remember one of my chaplains saying , '' You know God exists because He 's like a kite , '' and you can feel the tug on the string and know that He 's up there . '' I said , `` What if there 's no wind and the kite ca n't fly ? '' No , I ... I ca n't believe in God . I do n't believe in the immemorial wisdom of the East , but I do believe in you . Thank you . I very much want to finish what we started . Good . I brought some calculations in case you were feeling a bit better . And then I want to go home . Home ? As soon as I am able . Or if I should die , you have to promise that you will get me home . You 're not going to die . Oh , this came for you . I 'll leave you in peace . Try and do what the doctors ask . I know it 's not in your nature . JANAKI : why you have chosen to forsake me . Just a letter in response to the multitude I have sent you would have been enough . I have gone to be with my brother and his family where I will remain . This last letter is to say good-bye . What happened ? Page 36/41 I do n't know . He 's a terrible patient . Does n't believe in medicine . Wo n't eat anything . Just prays to his Namagiri . Well , I 'd be praying too if you were my doctor . And I 'm a bloody atheist . ( COUGHING ) This is my fault . ( RASPING ) Yes , maybe . We are within .004 . This ca n't die with me , Mr. Hardy . You 're not going to die . If this is correct , ( PUFFING ) you 'll make a difference . ( GASPING ) I have the proofs . My God . He did it . He really did it . Now he must be a Fellow . Oh , be practical , Hardy . He 'll only fail again . Not with your help , he wo n't . Besides , there is another way . If he was a ... If he had a Royal Fellowship ... - An FRS ? - Mmm . He 's Indian ! MacMahon , listen to me . He really needs this . ( SIGHS ) See that this gets to Lieutenant Littlewood . Littlewood ? Where ? Mr. Hobson , Mr. Baker , I have someone who wishes to talk to you about Mr. Ramanujan . Gentlemen . Trinity denied him . I just want the opportunity to make the case . Try him on his merits . Suit yourself . But I think you'll Page 37/41 find the result will be the same . - Hardy . - Morning . Now what have you got yourself involved with ? John . Good of you to come . Would n't have missed it for the world . So , now we see the work on partitions and the enormous breakthrough that has been achieved . All this , mind you , by a man whose limitations of knowledge when I met him were as startling as was its profundity . Opinions may differ as to the importance of Ramanujan 's work and the influence it may or may not have on the mathematics of the future , but one gift it does show is its profound and invincible originality . Mr. Littlewood once told me that `` every positive integer is one of Ramanujan 's personal friends . '' I believe this to be true . He told me that an equation for him had no meaning unless it expressed a thought of God . Well , despite everything in my being set to the contrary , perhaps he is right . For is this not exactly our justification for pure mathematics ? We are merely explorers of infinity in the pursuit of absolute perfection . We do not invent these formulae , they already exist and lie in wait for only the very brightest of minds , like Ramanujan , ever to divine and prove . So , in the end , I have been forced to consider , who are we to question Ramanujan , let alone God ? Page 38/41 Thank you . ( CHATTER ) It 's bad enough that this charlatan has wasted our time once . And now Hardy has dragged the only person in the world who will support him out of the trenches . No , enough is enough with this ... This Ramujin . Littlewood is not the only one . I think he has the finest mind I 've seen in my lifetime . And his name is Ramanujan . LITTLEWOOD : I 'm a Fellow of the Royal Society . He wrote to me . Janaki . ( SOBBING ) If you had gone to him , he would never return . ( SOBS ) Are you really gon na go home ? War is over . It is time . Well , as a Fellow of the Royal Society , they 're gon na be really proud of you . - I owe you so much . - No , no , no . It 's I who owe you . Come on . Come on the grass . You 're late . But , sir , I ca n't . I 'm not a Fellow over here . Are you sure about that ? Well , as an FRS , what could they say ? Repeat after me . `` I , Srinivas Ramanujan , '' elected Fellow of Trinity College ... '' I , Srinivas Ramanujan , elected Fellow of Trinity College . Sorry I 'm late . Bloody cab driver got lost . Should have known from his number . And what was that ? Rather a dull one . No , Hardy . Page 39/41 ( CLEARS THROAT ) It is a very interesting number . It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways . ( CHUCKLES ) Have you notified your family ? Just not her . I do n't even know if she got my letter . I ... I ... I 'm rather out of my depth in such affairs , but ... But I will say this . There are no proofs nor underlying laws that can determine the outcome of matters of the heart . Of this I 'm sure . Perhaps when we meet again you will have such matters of your own . Well , perhaps . ( CHUCKLES ) I will miss you , my friend . I will miss you . So , I want a letter with you with all your new work , every week . And come back to us in a year 's time . I promise . ( SEAGULLS CRY ) ( BELL TOLLING ) Afternoon post , sir . Thank you . India . At last . Is he coming back , sir ? It is difficult to put into words ... What I owe Ramanujan . His originality has been a constant source of suggestion to me ever since I first met him . And his death is one of the worst blows I have ever felt . But now I say to myself when I 'm depressed , and I find myself forced to listen Page 40/41 to tiresome and pompous people , '' Well , I 've done something you could never have done . `` I have collaborated with both Littlewood and Ramanujan '' on something like equal terms . '' ( SOBS ) Let 's take this one . What ? I do n't see what 's so special about this one . Neither did I at first . Page 41/41
2009;Scripts.com Creation By John Collee Page 1/36 Papa ? - Tell me a story . - Alright . What about ? I do n't know . About everything . Everything ? Very well , then . In Tierra del Fuego , land of fire ... ... a blighted and loveless country on the Earth 's furthest rim , lives a community of the dirtiest , most vulgar , least civilised people you can possibly imagine . They appeared almost entirely naked with their hair all the way down to their bottoms . They never washed their hands or their faces , even before dinner . One day , Captain Fitzroy went ashore to meet them . Thank you . Not long now . I shall be with you presently . Head to me , please . Very good . Now , very still , please . No fidgeting . And above all , no smiling . - Excuse me , sir ? - Hmm ? - Will this hurt ? - Oh , no , no , no . It is only a beam of light . - Papa ? - Hmm ? How can light make a picture ? Well , they take a copper plate and they prepare it with chemicals , and these chemicals are activated by the light that reflects back from your face , and so the silver sticks to the places where the light is brightest . Understand ? Yes . - Sorry . So sorry . Page 2/36 - No , thank you . - Go on . He went ashore to meet them . - Yes , that 's right . So , erm , Captain Fitzroy went ashore to interview the Fuegians . Now . He offered them some axe heads , some calico , and very pretty buttons . Total value , probably two shillings . This is yours . You take it . Look how it ... Look how it glisters . See ? And all he asked in return ? A few spare children . You give me el nia . To the Fuegians , children were cheap and buttons were precious , so it was n't long before the Fuegians had their trinkets and Captain Fitzroy had his three children . He named them Boat Memory ... ... Jemmy Button and Fuegia Basket . Come here , you dirty little beggar ! The good captain had them washed and dressed , and he taught them the proper table manners . Boat Memory died of smallpox , but the two littlest ones , they learned their prayers and their times-tables so excellently that they were invited to meet the King and Queen . Everyone agreed that good Christian values had tamed the most savage of hearts . The King gave Jemmy a genuine brass telescope and the Queen gave Fuegia one of her Sunday best bonnets to keep for ever . Two years later , Captain Fitzroy and I took them home , Page 3/36 accompanied by a young missionary , in the belief that , by example , they would bring their fellow savages to God . And what do you think happened ? It did n't work . That 's right . Of course it did n't work ! - Go after them , you fool ! Get them now . - Jemmy ! Fuegia ! Put your clothes back on ! Come back ! It was a complete and total failure . No , no , no ! Quite still , did n't I say ? You shall have to do it all over again . So sorry . So badly behaved . So sorry . Mr Darwin , sir ? Come on , Mr Darwin , or your dinner will be spoiling . Mr D will be in presently , ma'am . I imagine . - Thank you , Mrs Davies . - Is Papa unwell again ? - He 's always unwell these days . - He is not , Franky . Maybe he caught something awful from the Hottentots . Nanny Brodie said God was angry with him . - Brodie said no such thing . - Yes , she did ! - Good evening . - Good evening , Papa . Sorry I 'm so late . Soup du jour , sir . Thank you , Parslow . Lord God , bless this family and the food we eat . - We ask in Thy name . Amen . - Amen . I hear Mr Hooker is coming tomorrow . Yes . Yes , that 's right . Did he say what it was about ? I 'm not sure that now 's the time to discuss it . Page 4/36 Perhaps the time to discuss it was before you invited him . Well , quite possibly , but he ... He invited himself . Sorry . Tell Mrs Davies it was delicious , but my ... My stomach 's still not quite what it ... it should be . Forgive me . - Can we go fishing ? - Can we pick gooseberries ? October 17th , 1858 . Passed a poor night . Stomach still wretched . Noticed a slight tremor in right hand . Consider increasing laudanum by ten per cent , perhaps . We 'll sacrifice the two tumblers . I want to skeletonise them . Yes , sir . Selective breeding is undoubtedly working . Already seeing real changes in wing structure . I 'm convinced that all fancy breeds , pouter , carrier , tumbler et cetera , derive from the common rock pigeon . Nature selects for survival , man for appearance . Must improve skeletonising methods . Consider aqua regia , quicklime , perhaps . They 'll need a few more hours , those , sir . Master George ! Master Franky ! Lady Etty and Master Lenny . How are you , sir ? - Sir ? - Thank you . Anything else , sir ? No , no , no , you ... carry on . I 'll clean myself up . Is it true that he only let you go if you married his fattest daughter ? Absolutely true , George , but do n't you dare tell my wife . Page 5/36 - Dear Joseph . - Dearest Emma . Ah . Yes . Forgive the short notice . - You know Thomas Huxley ? - Only by reputation . - He insisted on coming . - It 's a lie . I have a question for your esteemed , reclusive husband and I did n't trust Hooker to ask it for me . I see . Children , tell Papa his visitors are here . - He already knows . - He 's hiding . Do come in , please . Can we play Charge of the Light Brigade ? You must be exhausted . Will you take tea ? Hooker ! My dear fellow ! And Huxley . Do come in . Come in . Lead the charge , boys . And away we go . We 're re-forming the Linnean Society . The committee will comprise of myself , Lyell , Hooker , yourself , of course , if you 're game for it . Now that Hooker and I finally have a bit of clout , we can start to reclaim science as a profession . Wrest it away from the country parsons and beetle collectors . - Some of whom are friends . - Your book will be our rallying point . No , it wo n't . There is no book . There are fragments , and they 're not in any fit state to publish . I 've read your abstract and the argument is hugely powerful . Clear evidence of transformation over millions of years from a free-swimming prawn to a shellfish stuck on a rock . Page 6/36 That 's my point . You ca n't be sure of that , and that 's why I need more time . - Mr Darwin , sir ? - Yes ? Either you are being disingenuous or you do not fully understand your own theory . Evidently , what is true of the barnacle is true of all creatures , even humans . The Almighty can no longer claim to have authored every species in under a week . You 've killed God , sir . You have killed God . Or to put it another way ... And I say good riddance to the vindictive old bugger ! - Charles ? Charles ? - Oh , no , I 'm fine , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . - Thomas , please . - Yes , I quite understand . It is time to write your book . Strike hard and fast with a blow that is utterly conclusive . Really , sir , you ... You talk as if we 're at war . Yes . Science is at war with religion , and when we win , we 'll finally be rid of those damned archbishops and their threats of eternal punishment . No , Mr Huxley , we ... We live in a society and it is a society bound together by the Church . An improbable sort of barque , I grant you , but at least it floats . It floats . And you would what ? You would have us all rebuild , plank by plank , the very vessel in which we sail ? Oh , come , come , Charles ! Did ... Did God 's laws change your Fuegians ? Was Jenny the ape any less personable for not being a person ? Our behaviour , like our physical forms , evolves according to our needs . Page 7/36 Your very own words , sir ! And thus , in time , we lose those parts that are no longer required . Like the appendix , the male nipple , and finally , thank Christ , our belief in an utterly redundant Almighty ! Mr Hooker ? I ... implore you , please do not push him . No one can push Charles . You know how fixed he is . - Bit of a barnacle himself , really . - Yes . And if you prise him from his rock , he will die . Come on , Hooker . It 'll be dark soon . So , what did she say to you ? She said it was killing him . Yes . Mighty slow death considering the length of time he 's sat on this stuff . We shall all be dead and buried ourselves if he takes much longer . Yes , since his girl died , one has to admit ... he 's not the man he was . When are you going to be done with those stinky old barnacles ? Well , I 've been chasing this little crustacean in all of its evolutionary forms over 30 million years . Now , eight years does n't seem a very long time to achieve that , does it ? What does `` procrastinating '' mean ? Oh , I think you know very well what it means , Annie . It means putting things off . Why ? That 's what Mr Hooker thinks you 're doing . Does he indeed ? Is it because of Mama or what 's in that box ? Both . Page 8/36 - I should probably just burn the lot . - You ca n't . I 'm in it . Do n't be absurd ! Of course you 're not . - What do you mean ? - When I was a baby , you said . - Oh , that . - The Natural History of Babies . Yes , that 's right . Look at my finger . Oh , you 're so strong ! You 're so strong ! Here . Annie . I think that will not help her sleep . I 'm sure you 're probably right . Who 's that ? Who is that ? Is that you ? Oh , sweetheart . Oh , I 'm so sorry . Oh , what a mean old papa you have . Oh , sweetheart ! Oh , what a mean old papa you have ! What a mean old ... What a mean old man you have ! Oh , I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . `` Six weeks : '' Tries to suck . Holds tight to my finger . '' `` Perceives bosom when three or four inches from it . '' I should add that she 's musical . I hope you do not plan to treat all our children as specimens of the ape genus to be included in your experiments . All of our children ? You mean you want more ? Oh , sorry . I assumed . No , if the idea does n't appeal , then we wo n't have any more children . Darling , I have plans to breed an entire army of them . Look at that . That 's called the waltz . Careful , now ! Not too far ahead . - Make yourself useful , Hooker . - Stay away from that water ! Fear not , Brodie , Page 9/36 I have them in my sights . Children ! Now , which of the four of you would be the first who would like to learn how to hook a worm ? Me ! Me ! `` A little further on , the leading Highlander snuffed the wind like a setting Spaniel , and then made a signal to his party again to halt . '' `` He stooped down upon all fours , wrapped up in his plaid ... '' - Look what I found , Mama . - Look at that . - What shall I feed it ? - Let 's ask Reverend Innes . Oh , erm ... A leaf , I should think . Necrophorus humator , is n't he , Charles ? - Rather a splendid specimen . - Yes , he is . He 's a ... carnivore . He eats carrion and insects . Boys ! We need carrion and insects ! Look , here 's a worm , here 's a worm . - An earwig ! Squish it ! - No , do n't kill it . I know that expression . He 's dreaming of his glory days when he was unencumbered with wife and family . Free to wander the planet . Actually , I was ... I was remembering how the tropical seas teemed with living particles that seemed to surround the Beagle with a luminous glow and leave a glistening pathway through the night . Puzzling . So much beauty for so little purpose . So little purpose ? They were helping to light the ship 's way . Well said . Exactly . John , are you familiar with the works of Thomas Malthus ? Page 10/36 - He married his first cousin . - So did I . - Yes , but I was n't suggesting that ... - Of course you were n't . Anyway , Thomas Malthus calculated that if , well , if every trout , say , had a hundred or so offspring and so on and so forth throughout the generations , we 'd be knee-deep in trout in just a few decades . How would you respond to that ? I 'd respond by saying that most of the eggs are destroyed or eaten so that the numbers remain stable . That 's the beauty of God 's plan . It does n't strike you as a wasteful plan , these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished ? - They provide food for others . - Cheese and cucumber ? Thousands die so that only a few may live . Is not the sum total of happiness in some sort of massive deficit ? Charles , it is really not my duty to speculate on the mind of God , but it does seem to me that nature is at peace . There is another view . That all of nature is a battlefield . Remind me where I read that . - This is very good . - Good . Shall I continue ? Hmm , please do . `` In a short time , he returned , and dismissed his attendants , excepting one , and intimating to Waverley that he must imitate his cautious way ... '' '' 'Now , ' thought Christian , 'What shall I do ? '' ' Page 11/36 '' And ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance with sparks and hideous noises that Christian was forced to put up his sword and betake himself to another weapon called All Prayer . '' Let us stop there . Is Papa not coming to kiss us goodnight ? He is a little unwell from working . Maybe tomorrow . You said that last night . I think when Annie died , he stopped loving us . No , Etty . He 's just a little bit tired and a little bit busy . Goodnight , darling . - What are you doing , Annie ? - I 'm making you beautiful . But I need to think . What are you so scared of ? - It 's only a theory . - No , they 're right . It changes everything . Suppose the whole world stopped believing that God had any sort of plan for us . That nothing mattered . Not love , not trust . Not faith , not honour . Only brute survival . Apart from anything else , it would break your mother 's heart . Hearts ca n't break , silly . You told me that . Breathe in , Papa . Breathe out . - Tell me a story . - Alright . What about ? About Jenny . - It 's late . I have no time . - Please ? - Why Jenny ? It 's so sad . - I like sad stories . Page 12/36 Once upon a time , there was a family of orang-utans living in the deepest jungles of Borneo . Their eldest daughter was the most loving , the most caring , and the most trusting orang of all . But she was also the most ... Intelligent . Well , I was going to say inquisitive . Did I neglect to mention she was not always the most obedient of creatures ? By the time she realised her danger , it was too late . They put her in a bag and they carried her off ... Much to her loving parents ' despair . So sorry . Much to her loving parents' despair , of course . And the Dayaks bundled her into a cage and set off to sell her down the river . They sold her to a trader for threepence , three farthings , and he put her in a bigger cage and sold her to London Zoo for 300 guineas . She was the first orang-utan that anyone had ever seen in England . Everyone peered at Jenny , and Jenny peered back , and she marvelled at what strange creatures they all were . The curators of the zoo , they ... they cleaned her up ... ... made her presentable for polite society . Which was when I was first introduced to her . What is that , Jenny ? Oh , come on . Bravo ! When eventually it came time to say goodbye , she grew quite downcast Page 13/36 and refused to shake my hand . Finally , she took it , but only after I 'd made her a promise I was never able to keep : that I would visit her again very soon . Go on . Tell me about the bit where she gets sick and dies . - Why do you want to hear that bit ? - I like it . It makes me cry . Huxley is of the opinion that I should write and be done with it . Says it 's a question of moral courage , or of ... Or rather my lack of it . Did you tell him about your health ? His theory is that I 'm making myself ill by holding back , and ... that I should lance the boil , so to speak . Thank the Lord he 's no longer a surgeon . I have concluded that he 's right . You know , bite the gag . Speed is everything . It will all be over in a matter of months . It is not mere months ... ... nor even years nor decades that concern me , Charles . Do you really care ... ... so little for your immortal soul ? Charles ... do you not care that you may never pass through the gates of heaven and that you and I may be separated for all eternity ? Well , of course I care . Of course I do . What do you think has kept me in limbo all these years ? I am a neuter bee . I 'm a scientist , and I dare not study for the fear of seeing more clearly what is already as plain as day to me . Do you not think that 's torture enough ? Page 14/36 I think you are at war with God , Charles . We both know it is a battle you can not win . - Give me the ball ! - No , you cheated ! - Curse you , woman ! - You cheated ! Etty ! Etty , Etty , Etty ! - Were you never married , Brodie ? - Myself ? No . He went off to Australia . I missed my chance . I shall never marry . I know how men give you babies . I sincerely hope you do not , Annie Darwin ! Everybody step back and look at the rock . If you look at it , really look at it , it can take us back through time . See these greyish , muddy layers ? They were brought here by quiet , patient , gentle rivers , whereas these dramatic sandstone deposits are telling us of huge storms , storms that came through here millions of years ago when Aunt Sarah was just a little girl and Down Village was a swamp full of dinosaurs . - What 's a dinosaur ? - It 's a lizard ... - Professor Owen invented them . - He did n't exactly invent them . - They were n't real ! - Yes , they were . Put some clothes on ! You 're going blue . Look what I found ! Spiny starfish ! Do n't tell me . Marthasterias gacialis , look ! Glacialis . Page 15/36 Whoo ! Whoo ! I am Fuegian ! I 'm making custard ! He did , he told me ! It is not fair to the other children , nor to Annie herself , that her head be filled with these ideas . - But Daddy said ! - I will leave you to deal with this . - He did , he told me ! - Hush . Goodbye , Annie . What happened ? Nothing . Your knees . What happened to your knees ? Reverend Innes had to have words with her . What happened to her knees ? Reverend Innes sent me to the corner and made me kneel on rock salt . - Why ? - I said there were dinosaurs , and he said there were n't . But you found them ! - Where 's my coat ? - Take her to the kitchen , will you ? Where 's my coat ? He told her to kneel until she repented , so the marks are a result of her own stubbornness . - She contradicted him repeatedly . - Listen to yourself . Emma ! How dare he torture our children for expressing the truth ? - It is not the truth as he sees it . - Damn how he sees it ! Must our children be revolutionaries at nine years of age ? He is teaching them to deny the evidence of their own senses . No more than I have told them at bedtime . Page 16/36 It is the instruction of our parents and grandparents . It 's what all of the village believe , or try to . Charles , Reverend Innes is a dear friend and neighbour . Please , do not set yourself against him . I beg you . For you . Not for him . All things bright and beautiful All creatures great and small All things wise and wonderful The Lord God made them all Let us pray . Lord God ... we know the world is governed by Thy plan ... ... extending to the merest creatures Thou hast made , such that even a sparrow falls not to the ground without Thy will . Teach us that all misfortune , all sickness and death , all the trials and miseries of which we daily complain ... ... are intended for our good ... ... being not the whims of an uncaring universe ... ... but the corrections of a wise ... and affectionate parent . Teach us this in Thy name , O Lord . - Amen . - Amen . The lesson today is taken from the Book of Genesis . - Chapter one , verses 26 to 30 . - Sorry . - Excuse me . I 'm so sorry . - And God said , '' Let us make man in our image , after our likeness . '' `` And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over Page 17/36 all the cattle and over all the Earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth . '' Dearest Emma , last night you said I was at war with God , but truly it is nothing so dramatic as a war , just a silent struggle with myself extended over a thousand afternoons . The loss of religious faith is a slow and fragile process , like the raising of continents . What can I say to you except that the process now seems complete ? - What are we looking at ? - See the rabbit ? Stay very still . Make it stop . Quickly , Daddy , make it stop . - Quickly ! - Etty . Etty , darling . - Daddy , make it stop . - Ssh . Darling girl . Dear girl . - Dear sweet girl . - It 's not fair ! - It 's not fair ! - I 'm sorry . - Not fair . - It 's not fair . Etty , it has to be that way . The fox has to eat the rabbit , otherwise the fox 's babies will die . It 's the balance of things . Come on , little duck . Give us a smile . Dear Hooker , I am finally decided . I think I owe it to my children to at least have the courage of my own convictions . My title will be '' On the Origin of Species '' , and I shall endeavour to keep God out of it , although no doubt Page 18/36 He will see it as a personal attack . Nothing is easier than to admit the truth of the universal struggle for life , or more difficult than to constantly bear this in mind . I shall devote my first chapter to variations under domestication , wherein we will see how great is the power of man in accumulating slight variations . I will then pass on to see how natural selection causes much extinction ... ... of the less-improved forms of life . - Charles ? - Yes ? What is Lewis making ? He 's making a water tower like the one they have at Malvern . The writing 's not been going well , so I thought I might try my own water cure . You 're still angry with me . I can always tell by your playing . Not angry . Sad . Pull . The face of nature may be compared to a yielding surface with 10,000 sharp wedges packed close together and then driven inwards by incessant blows . Sometimes one wedge being struck and then another with great force . The mind can not possibly grasp the full meaning of the term a hundred million years . It can not add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations . We forget how largely these songsters or their eggs or their nestlings are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey . Thus , over tens of thousands of generations , Page 19/36 tiny variations accumulate . Organs change their very function . The female sexual organ becomes a cement gland . Limbs become blind feelers or fall away entirely . What was once a free-swimming creature finds itself glued by its head to a rock , blindly flailing for food . Papa ! Why is sweating supposed to be good for you ? Because it gets rid of the poisons in your blood . - I thought you did n't believe in sin . - I do n't . Not in the way Reverend Innes understands it , anyway . Then why are you afraid of going to hell ? - I 'm not . - Yes , you are . - You think you deserve it . - No , I do n't . Of course I do n't . What could possibly make you think that ? Because you think you should never have had me . Oh , for God 's sake , girl . Oh , I do n't have to listen to this nonsense . You 're cruel . You 're just being cruel . The girl 's gone mad . That 's why you wo n't talk to Mama any more . Enough of this . I talk to her . Of course I talk to her . Not about the important things . Not about me ! - Why must everything be about you ? - That 's what you wo n't talk about . - What ? - How you think you 're responsible . Get out of here . Page 20/36 You get out of here . Get out of here . You said honesty was the most important thing in the world . If you wo n't be honest , I won't come again . It 'll serve you right ! Get out ! Please , get out ! Get out ! You have not been well for months now . I 'll be fine . I 'm fine . - Will you talk to John Innes ? - What about ? - Whatever it is that ails you . - What is he now , exactly ? What is he ? - He 's a physician , is he ? - Yes . A physician of souls , anyway . Talk to him as a friend . You used to be such friends . I think he can help you . Mr Darwin ? Excuse me . Little 'un coming through . Ah , Mr Darwin . I was just explaining to Mr Goodman about your interest in breeding . Oh , good . Excellent . Mr Goodman is our foremost pigeon fancier in all of southern England . I swear , he can give you any beak or plumage within four generations . - What 's your secret ? - I interbreed them . Brother and sister , cousin with cousin . It 's the fastest way to alter the strain . There 's a danger that you 'll weaken it , but a gentleman like yourself , I 'm sure you can afford to lose a few chicks , eh ? Now , plenty of rest , young lady . Down you go . Keep her warm . - Thank you , Doctor . - Goodbye , Annie . Goodbye . Unfortunately , if we let them run wild on the beach , Page 21/36 we have to expect the consequences , do we not , Mrs Darwin ? - So , increase the calomel to twice ... - I will not give her any more of it . - Why not ? - She 's been taking it for weeks . - Can you not see she 's not ... - It is chloride of mercury . - I 've prescribed it often in babies . - Not to any of mine . - If she would submit to being bled ... - Please , no . - I will write to Dr Gully again . - The hydrotherapist ? I have found his treatments very effective . - No matter that they defy logic ? - Logic is n't everything . Clearly not . - I 'll see myself out . Good day , madam . - Good day . I should take her to Malvern to be treated as I was . It is better she 's here . She needs her family . She needs love and rest . She 'll get well . One more week . We 'll watch her for one more week . Alright ? Thank you . Papa ! Post for you , sir . This one 's from the Spice Islands . Charles . Charles , my old friend , there you are . May I join you ? Yes . Yes , of course . Mrs Darwin has told me about the book you are writing . Oh , no , no , not any more . Thank goodness . You mean you finished it ? It 's been finished for me , actually . Page 22/36 A Mr Alfred Russel Wallace has arrived independently at exactly the same opinion . Expressed in a ... In a mere 20 pages . Now , there 's brevity for you . I had covered 250 so far and come to a dead end , so whilst having wasted 20 years on the project , I am at least rid of it . Well . Well ... ... the Lord moves in mysterious ways . Hmm , yes , He does , does n't He ? You know , I was remarking only the other day how He has endowed us in all of His blessed generosity with not one but 900 species of intestinal worm , each with its own unique method of infiltrating the mucosa and burrowing through to the bloodstream . And on the love that he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp that lays its eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillars . I have said on many occasions , it is not for us to speculate at His reason . No , we can leave that to Mr Wallace . Shall I advise him to stay abroad , do you think ? With his opinions , if he shows his face around here , he may be required to kneel on rock salt . I always valued our friendship . Until now , I regarded you as one of those rare mortals with whom one could disagree and yet feel no shade of animosity . Sadly , that feeling is ... no longer reciprocated . Page 23/36 What ? I 'm forestalled by Wallace . What have I done ? What ? What possible ... What possible reason could you have to be angry at me ? Annie . Annie ! Annie ! Come here ! Come back ! Come back here now ! I am your father ! You ... You come back here ! What ? What did I do ? What did I do to you ? What ? Annie ! C-Come here ! Come back ! What did I do to you ? Please ! Annie , please ! Come here ! Annie ! Annie ! Come here ! Get rid of them . Get rid of all of them . Come on . Get out ! Get out ! Go ! Come on ! Get out ! Go ! Go ! Mr Darwin . Mr ... Mr Darwin . Mr Darwin , sir ! Mr Darwin ? I 'll have Lewis dismantle it , sir . Now , Mr Darwin , I 'll send for Dr Holland . God , no . God damn it . Damn it all to hell . Mr Darwin ? Help me here ! Help me here ! So , increase the calomel to twice a day . - Yes , of course . - Keep him warm , plenty of rest ... I think Papa 's going to die , too . Oh . Hello , Hooker . Hello . Still talking . That 's good . Word had reached London you 'd suffered an apoplectic stroke . Your enemies are celebrating Page 24/36 at the Athenaeum . I have no enemies . - This is the Wallace letter ? - Yes . Well , he has 20 pages . You have a whole book , or at least half of one . I intend to extract the other even if it kills us both . Have you been talking to Huxley again ? No . Had I been , he 'd be here himself with a cat-o'-nine-tails . Up you come . No , I can not . I know not what ails me , but it 's more than I can endure . Bosh ! You have had this illness as long as I have known you . It 's worse in times of overwork , but it has nothing to do with your soul , wherever that resides now . - Go and get yourself treated . - I can not . Believe me , you do have enemies . I 'll bet half the nation would see you burnt at the stake if they knew what you were writing , but you have friends , too , and all of us are fighting the same battle . And we can win this in our lifetimes . We have to win this . I implore you , go to Malvern , take your blessed water cure , come back and win it for us . - She 's nearly ready . - Thank you . Move those quickly , please . - I want to come with you . - No . - Malvern 's not so far . - Parslow ! It 's two days by coach . - What if the baby comes early ? - They have doctors there . - Your job is here with the children . - They also need their father . I ca n't care about the other children Page 25/36 now . I can only care about Annie ! Mind her shawl , make sure it 's tucked in . Alright , thank you . Thank you . Alright , little frog . - I made these . It 's Annie 's favourite . - Thank you . You will see your mama when you 're well again . - Brodie , get aboard . - No ! No ! - Say goodbye , now . - No , I do n't want to say goodbye ! - Say goodbye now . - No , I 'm going with you . I 'm going with you . Wait there ! Wait for me ! Go ! Go now . Walk on . Mr Darwin , old friend . Mr Darwin . How long has it been ? I have n't clapped eyes on you since ... Well ... So , what have we now ? What have we now ? Tongue ? Hmm-hm . Shirt up . Let me feel your liver . Right . Up . Pulse hectic , tongue furred , liver tender and enlarged . And obviously you 've been exercising your brain every hour that God gave you . - I have been writing a book . - Madness ! There are far too many of those already . - Are you sleeping ? - Poorly . And I suppose never taking the 50c dilution of Chelidonium ? I had my carpenter build a water tower . It no longer has any effect . Of course not ! Your carpenter is n't a hydrotherapist . - What on Earth possessed you ? - I feared I was dying . Page 26/36 Oh , come , come , come . We shall not have that talk here . A sharp spinal scrub , cold douche daily at 7:00am , and sweating by the lamp . No red meat , no reading , no mental agitation of any kind . We shall soon have you right , Mr Darwin . We shall soon have you right . Papa ? I think I 'm feeling better now . Honestly . Papa ! Sir , I kneel before You in all humility . If it is in Your power , God , to save her ... ... then I will believe in You for the rest of my days . Take me , if You must take someone , but not her . She ... She 's such a good little girl , you see . She ... I ask this in the name of Your child and mine and in the name of all children . Thank you . Amen . With what do you most associate these symptoms ? Eating ? Strong emotion ? Physical exertion ? Any particular action ? - Is ... Is memory an action ? - Memory of what ? - My daughter . - Of course . You must accept there was nothing more to be done . Oh , dear fellow ... she is in heaven . Yes , that 's what my wife believes . It is a great consolation to her . But not you ? She and I are divided on it . - Were you always ? - No . Only since Annie died . Whoa , there . Page 27/36 Charles , I 'm ... I 'm so very sorry about Annie . - Where is she ? - In the Lady Chapel . Thank you . Thank you . Since that time , she has sought refuge in religion , and I in science . Has this division ... affected your marital relations ? We have none any more ... to speak of . Perhaps that 's for the best . Meaning ? Our last baby ... Baby Ch ... Baby Charlie . He barely survived beyond infancy and ... Are you familiar with the writings of de Quincey ? Yes , I ... I 've read him . I have no time for the man . He maintains that certain thoughts can reside in our mind ... ... without us being aware of them . They then may manifest as boils and fainting spells ... and ghosts . It 's po ... It 's possible , yes . Annie is buried here in Malvern , is she not ? - Yes . - And have you yet visited the grave ? - I really do not wish to discuss this . - Of course ... - What possible bearing can it have ? - It has every bearing . That is your opinion . Your treatments have been effective . I feel cured . I think not , sir . I think you 're not yet cured . - Do you have faith , Mr Darwin ? - What ? You say you take no comfort from religion , but do you have faith ? Until you do , all the waters in the world will not be the cure of you . Annie ? Page 28/36 Annie ! Annie ! Annie ! Annie ! Annie ! Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? - Good evening . - Good evening . I 'm Mr Darwin . I lodged here some time ago . Room number 12 , was n't it ? Yes , it was . I would only be ten minutes or so . First floor . - Last room on the right . - Yes , I remember . Thank you . I have the embrocation . - Does she want for anything else ? - No , I 'm sure that will do admirably . Alright . Alright , little one . Here we go . Now , then . Just rub this on . - How 's that ? Better ? - Yes . Dearest Emma , I think it best for you to know how each day passes . Doctor Gully 's treatments are having some effect at last . I will write again tomorrow , but in the meantime ... The surgeon came today to draw off Annie 's water . This did not hurt her , and seemed to give much relief . I asked if there was any immediate threat to her life , but he believes she has turned the corner . My Emma , Annie rallied yesterday . For a moment , I was foolish with delight , but now , suddenly , our dear child Page 29/36 has taken a turn for the worse . This last attack was first thought to be of the smallest importance but rapidly assumed the form of a low and dreadful fever . She talks a great deal , but we can seldom make out anything . Look , Mama , I 'm a general ! Much of what she says we can not make out from the roughness of her poor mouth . - We sponged her with water and vinegar . - There we are . - Made her sweet with chloride of lime . - Alright . Gully thinks our poor , sweet child is in imminent danger . Is that better , my darling ? Is that better ? Beautifully good . I 'm making custard . My darling Emma , I miss you , terribly . More now than ever . I often think of the precious looks Annie gives you . You were always the tenderest of human beings to her and comfort her so on all occasions . This dreadful alternation of hope and no hope sickens the soul . I feel we must prepare ourselves for the worst . Tell me about Jenny . What about Jenny ? Ab ... About how she dies . Please , Papa . I like it . Well ... what the keeper told me was this . When she was very sick with pneumonia , lying very still ... ... he tried to feed her with a spoon . But she shook her head and she looked at him as if to say ... Page 30/36 ... '' That 's very sweet of you . Really . '' `` We 're beyond that now . '' And the keeper was much moved by the gentleness of the little ape . And as he bent down to comfort her , she brought her arms up around his neck ... ... and looked into his eyes in the most human fashion . And then she laid her head against him ... ... and died . Oh , my darling girl , my darling girl ! Sorry . So sorry I startled you . Goodness , Charles . Take off your coat . - You 're dripping wet . - Emma , we need to talk . I went back to Worcester Road . I saw Annie . You 're hurting my arm . - I need to make you understand ... - I do not want to hear it . - I am glad you 're feeling better . - You 're not listening . I need you to listen or you will never understand . I understand perfectly . Do you think that I am deaf and blind ? You 've lived with her and spoken with her every day since she died . She is more real to you than we are . - She is dead , Charles . - I know she 's dead . She is dead ! What in God 's name is wrong with you ? Why can you not leave our poor girl in her grave ? You 're the one who wants to keep her alive , but on a cloud , dancing with little fairies . - I will not listen to this ! - In a night shift and snowy wings ! Page 31/36 Is that how her death was for you , Emma ? - Something gutted of darkness ? - Get away from me . Away from you ? There is a gulf between us ! We 're like some , some survivors of some shipwreck . Yes ! Yes , because of you ! You 've torn everything apart ! - How ? How ? How ? - With your cruel theories ! With the truth , Emma ! Just with the truth ! Open the door ! Open the ... Open the door ! Open this door ! Open it ! What do you want from me ? I want us to be honest with each other . About what ? About this ... nagging belief that you have nurtured . - That what ? - That I killed her . - I never said that . - But you think it , so you must say it . And say everything else that follows , that I should have kept her warm that day on the beach , that ... ... I should never have taken her to Malvern without you . I should have waited for you . I ... I should have . These are your thoughts , Charles . They are not mine . I was on the beach . And I let you go . I knew , when you left for Malvern ... ... that I would never see her again . And I hated you . I hated you for taking her , Charles . But I was her mother . And what was I thinking ? I could have insisted . I should have followed you up there . Page 32/36 I let her go . That 's the truth . And more than anything ... ... I have ... ... hated ... myself . Perhaps ... Perhaps we should never have married . Our blood was too close . You see , Emma ... I thought that we were making the perfect child . But perhaps instead we endowed her with the weakness that killed her . I just ... wanted to be with you so very much . The fact ... of it is ... ... knowing everything I now know ... ... I would marry you again tomorrow , my love . The affinities of all beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree . The green and budding twigs may represent existing species , and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species . So , I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life , which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the Earth , while covering the surface with its ... The frameworks of bones have been the same in the hand of a man , wing of a bat , fin of a porpoise and leg of a horse at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive ... It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank , clothed with many plants of many kinds , with birds singing on the bushes , Page 33/36 with various insects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms , so different from each other and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner , have all been produced by laws acting around us . `` Advancing gently forward over my breast , came almost up to my chin , and bending my eyes downwards as much as I could , I quivered . '' - Hello . - Hello . I was wondering if I might , might take over . Alright . Where were you ? `` I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high . '' Not the book . Please , a true story . Like you did with Annie . Alright . Let me think . Did I ever tell you about my riding with gauchos ? - Yes . - Yes . Or the time our ship was struck by Saint Elmo 's fire ? - Yes . - My attempt to climb the Andes ? - Yes . - Earthquakes ? - Yes . - Tidal waves ? - Really ? I did ? - Yes . Goodness gracious , I think I 've told you everything . And yet I fancy I have never told you about the giant sloth of Punta Alta . Page 34/36 No . Alright , then . Millions and millions of years ago , in a rich and verdant land that we now call Argentina ... ... there lived a mammal . There lived a mammal as large as an elephant , as gentle as a lemur and as slow as an incredibly slow snail . And he lived a happy life watching the slow green march of the passing seasons . Er ... I 've finished . I 've finished . - You decide . - About what ? Well , about what should be done with it . Someone needs to take God 's side in all of this . I 'd much rather it was you than Innes . Supposing I think it should be destroyed ? Well ... then you must do what you think is right . Read it first . Emma ? Well , you said it was my decision . Emma , where ... Where are you going ? To John Murray publishers . Do I have it right ? Yes . And so ... you have finally made an accomplice of me . May God forgive us both . - Good morning , Jim . - Morning , Mr Darwin , sir . - That parcel for me ? - Yes . Yes , it is . Thus , from the war of nature , from famine and death , the most exalted object we are capable of conceiving , namely the production of higher animals , Page 35/36 directly follows . There is grandeur in this view of life , that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity , from so simple a beginning , endless forms , most beautiful and most wonderful , have been , and are being , evolved .

1996;"THE ISLAND OF DR MOREAU by Richard Stanley & Michael Herr Revised by Walon Green Based upon the novel by H.G . Wells 4/26/94 FADE IN : EXT . SOMEWHERE IN NEW ENGLAND - DUSK A curtain of rain falls across the treetops descending upon the soft green hills and the patchwork farmsteads . A dog comes running along the crest of a hill , rejoicing , barking at the rain . The dog skids to a halt , shaking itself , turning its snout outward toward the fading light . CUT TO : INT . THE COTTAGE - DUSK A log spits on the hearth , sending firelight across the untidy room and the gaunt figure of EDWARD PRENDICK , who sits hunched in the semi-darkness , half listening to a COMPACT DISC RECORDING of a bluesy romantic ballad . Prendick glances down at the tabletop , at the piles of notepaper and the dense , crabbed handwriting that covers them , at the repeated sketches and doodles representing what we will come to recognize as the emblem of the Tree of Life ; at the empty coffee cups , the overflowing ashtray and the dismembered pieces of the 38 pistol that lie before him . He touches a button on a REMOTE CONTROL and the singing stops . He next touches the button on a TAPE RECORDER which whirrs to life . As Prendick speaks as he reaches down and begins to assemble the gun , his eyes unreadable , his lids red and bruised from lack of sleep , a week 's growth of stubble on his waxy cheeks . His movements are slow and deliberate . PRENDICK In a spirit of complete honesty , I want to say right from the start that I think we 've made some really incredible mistakes about God . We tell ourselves that He 's all-powerful , when we really should be questioning His competence . Believe me , I 'm not asking for miracles . A little adult leadership would do . Prendick brushes aside the papers on his desk and gropes around impatiently for a box of cartridges . PRENDICK As for God 's love , all I know for certain is that He loves our suffering . And as for His power ... well , maybe He can do whatever He wants with us , but there 's one thing I 'm pretty certain He ca n't do . When he 's sick of existing , He ca n't end it . Only we can do that ... Prendick opens the box and begins to load the revolver ; six cartridges . Then he stops , laughs , shakes his head , and empties out all but one cartridge . PRENDICK My name 's Edward Prendick . Until about ten years ago I was a lawyer , specializing in what was mis-named Human Rights . In August of 2007 , I was travelling as Special Envoy for the United Nations as a part of the effort to stop the bloody civil war in Micronesia . That 's where it began . This is where it will end . Prendick raises the revolver and almost touches it to his lips , savoring the moment of his obliteration . THUNDER CRASHES on the soundtrack . CUT TO : EXT . THE SOUTH PACIFIC - DAY We are flying . Soaring above tropical rainclouds , mist stretching away beneath us , illuminated from within by pulsing veins of lightning . The canopy of cloud parts , giving way to a limitless vista of open sea , a horizon so vast that one can almost see the curve of the earth . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) Our plane went down in a magnetic storm just above the equator at roughly 165¤ longitude . We see a yellow dot in the distance now , a tiny life raft adrift in a world of water . There are THREE MEN aboard , two of them wearing the uniform of the United Nations peacekeeping force and the third , Prendick , dressed in the remains of a bedraggled threepiece suit , a life jacket around his neck . The two soldiers , one Nordic , the other vaguely Hispanic , are locked in a violent struggle while Prendick tries ineffectually to separate them . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) We 'd been adrift four days when the fever hit us . SOLDIER l ( Hispanic ) Stay away from me ! PRENDICK Leave him . SOLDIER 2 He ca n't last . His water can save us . PRENDICK Leave him ! We can make it through this . They 'll find us ! Soldier 2 does n't reply ; instead he makes a lunge for his comrade's throat . Prendick tries to grab the soldier 's legs but the dinghy rolls heavily and he loses his grip . The soldier administers a savage kick to his head and he goes down , one hand raised to protect his face , the other reaching for the flare gun . The second soldier has his hands around the first soldier 's throat and the two of them grapple desperately , locked in a death grip . Prendick raises the flare gun , levelling it at soldier 2 's head , his hand shaking . PRENDICK Let him go , you son of a bitch ! The man releases his companion who crumples to the floor of the raft , retching and gasping for breath . He turns slowly to face Prendick , staring with sun-glazed eyes down the wavering barrel of the flare gun . SOLDIER 2 You 're some fucking lawyer . Do n't 'you know the first law of nature is survival . PRENDICK We 're not animals ! The soldier eyes Prendick up and down , afraid to call his bluff . Then , with a yell , the soldier 1 springs at him , a survival knife glinting in his hand . PRENDICK No ! SOLDIER 1 Cabron ! Both men are screaming now , soldier 2 is driven back as his former comrade drives his blade into him , blood going everywhere . The soldier pulls away , staring in disbelief at his wound . He tries to get to his feet but the first soldier plunges the knife into him again . He doubles up , emitting a grunt , his hands grasping now at his assailant . The dinghy pitches heavily to one side and the wounded soldier goes overboard , dragging his comrade with him . He sinks like a stone but his murderer struggles for a moment , breaking free of his grip and trying to stay afloat as Prendick reaches out to him . Then there is a white flash in the water and he is dragged under with barely a yell , the life raft shivering as the creatures of the deep brush against its underside , jostling each other as they feed . Prendick collapses to the floor of the dinghy with a groan . He lies staring at the sky for a moment , alone now with the open sea . Slowly he begins to laugh , his laughter growing gradually louder and more uncontrollable . He raises the gun and squeezing the trigger sends a white magnesium flare arcing up into the vault of the sky . DISSOLVE TO : THE DISC OF THE SUN A dazzling , overexposed white . The SOUND of the hissing flare . DISSOLVE THROUGH WHITE TO : EXT . THE SAME OCEAN - DAY ( TWO DAYS LATER ) Prendick lies in the bottom of the dinghy watching the swaying horizon , his eyes unfocused , his face raw and blistered from the relentless sun . His head sways with the rise and fall of the ocean and all the horizon seems to sway with him , the earth and the sky and the shining crack that separates them . A dark smudge appears on the far horizon . Dancing . Drawing nearer . He closes his eyes . When he opens them again he sees the side of the freighter looming over him , a row of figures gathered at the rail , outlines shadowy against the sun . A MAN with a droopy Zapata moustache and sad eyes , his long flaxen hair tied back in a tail , an OLDER MAN , his angry , freckled face framed by red hair and lastly , standing beside them as if in a fever dream is the third man , a DARK MAN whose eyes shine feverishly . Hands lift Prendick . Dark , powerful hands . His head lolls back and he knows no more . CUT TO : INT . CABIN - DAY We see a CLOSEUP of the MAN with the moustache , ( MONTGOMERY ) looking solicitously down at Prendick . Prendick groans . MONTGOMERY Easy now , ole ' buddy . Prendick opens his eyes to find himself in a small untidy cabin crammed with specimen jars containing gaudy tropical orchids . A low animal SNARL comes from somewhere outside the cabin and Prendick glances around himself uneasily . MONTGOMERY Feel better ? PRENDICK Where am I ? MONTGOMERY You 're okay . Do n't worry . Prendick looks nervously down at himself as if to make sure he's all still there . Montgomery smiles reassuringly . PRENDICK Who are you ? MONTGOMERY My name 's Montgomery . PRENDICK What ship is this ? MONTGOMERY This shitbucket 's the Ipecacuanha . Sounds like a drug does n't it ? ( smiles ) We all dropped Ipecacuanha and bayed at the moon . Prendick is aware that he 's in the company of a real character . PRENDICK My name 's Edward Prendick . I have to get to Bougainville ... I 'm an international lawyer on assignment for the U.N .... they 'll be looking for me ... Prendick sits up , tries to stand . Montgomery gently pushes him back . Prendick is now aware he 's on an IV . MONTGOMERY Easy , Eddie , just relax . I 'm still hydrating you . In two days you 'll be in Port Moresby , you can contact your people there . PRENDICK Moresby 's our first stop ? MONTGOMERY Second . They have to land me first . PRENDICK Where ? MONTGOMERY An island ... where I live . But there 's limited communications ... no one you could call from there . PRENDICK A remote island ... ( dares a smile ) Everyman 's dream . MONTGOMERY Right , now it 's your turn to dream . I 'm gon na give you a shot . Montgomery holds up a hypodermic needle , tenderly pats Prendick's arm , and administers a shot . PRENDICK What is it ? MONTGOMERY Trust me blindly . You 'll like it . PRENDICK Are you a doctor ? MONTGOMERY Let 's say I 'm a para-medic . There is another burst of feral SNARLING from outside and this time there is a man 's voice as well . DAVIS GOD DAMN IT ! SHUT THEM UP ! Prendick glances up at the cabin ceiling and the direction of the muffled yells . MONTGOMERY That 's a great shot I just gave you , Edward . I 've known people who 'd sell their grandmothers for a shot like that , so do n't piss it away . Try and get some sleep . Prendick relaxes and the cabin goes blurry around the edges once more as the sleeping potion begins to take effect . MONTGOMERY There you go , Eddie ... Dream ... Prendick 's eyes wander down onto the lettering stencilled on one of the packing cases : 'DESTINATION : U.S. BIOSTATION , BRAVO RIO DELTA VIA SUVA . ' And from somewhere on deck the cries start up again , as Prendick drifts slowly down into oblivion . CUT TO : INT . THE SAME CABIN - DAY ( A DAY LATER ) Consciousness washes slowly back into Prendick 's mind as he finds himself watching a puddle of sunlight stretch slowly across the cabin ceiling . Prendick sits up to see that the cabin door is standing ajar and a fresh set of clothes are laid out for him at the foot of the bed . He gets slowly to his feet , rubbing his head catching a brief glimpse of his sun-scarred face in the cabin mirror . CUT TO : EXT . THE DECK - DAY Prendick glances about the freighter deck , blinking in the sunshine , not prepared by the SOUNDS for what he sees . The whole deck is littered with scraps of carrots , shreds of green stuff and indescribable filth . All along the starboard bulwark are big hutches filled with rabbits and there is a solitary llama squeezed into a cage forward . A number of grisly staghounds are fastened to the rail by muzzles and chains and in the center of the deck a huge black leopard sits cramped in a small iron cage . A short FIGURE ( M'LING ) sits beside the cage . There is something particularly arresting about M'Ling 's face , the slightest elongation of his features and an almost feral intensity that informs his expression . He gets to his feet and starts suddenly towards Prendick , a curious glow of excitement in his face . Prendick takes a step backwards and almost bumps into Montgomery who has appeared from the hatchway behind him and who now pushes past to come between Prendick and M'Ling . M'Ling steps back as if afraid . MONTGOMERY God damn it , M'Ling , what the hell 's the matter with you ? I told you to stay forward . M'LING They ... wo n't have me forward ... They say I disturb the animals . MONTGOMERY Come on , man , do n't give me that bullshit . I told you to fucking STAY FORWARD ! You want me to tell Dr. Moreau about this ? M'Ling turns slowly and moves away . Montgomery turns , glancing nervously back at Prendick . PRENDICK What are these animals ? They are interrupted by a loud YELP and a VOLLEY OF CURSES from the companionway . M'Ling runs pathetically back onto the deck pursued by a heavy , red-haired MAN in a white cap . M'Ling hesitates when he sees Montgomery and the red haired man catches up to him , striking him between the shoulder blades and sending him sprawling into the midst of the furiously barking staghounds . The red-haired man staggers onto the deck and Montgomery steps towards him angrily . MONTGOMERY Hey , Captain , lighten up . That man is a paid passenger . So tell your crew to keep their filthy hands off of him . DAVIS Or what ? ? I do what I like on my own ship ! Davis turns away and staggers across to the rail , Montgomery following him . MONTGOMERY You 've been hassling my man there since we got on board . ( Under his breath , to Prendick ) Most obvious case of drug psychosis I 've ever seen . DAVIS Drug what ! ? What 're you talking about there ? MONTGOMERY Maritime Law . This man happens to be a lawyer . DAVIS Here 's the maritime law on my ship . ( He pulls out a pistol . ) I do n't like freaks aboard , you hippy burn-out . Montgomery turns away as Davis shouts after him . DAVIS He comes to this end of the ship again and I'll cut his guts out ! The animals go crazy when they smell him . Prendick feels impelled to step in . PRENDICK Just a minute . I 'm a Special Envoy for the United Nations ... DAVIS You 're tits on a bull so you stay out of this ... United Nations ... Freeloading bastard , taking up space on my ship . Side with him and you 'll sink with him . Hear me ? Speechless , Prendick watches Davis stumble back down the companionway . When he glances around he sees that both Montgomery and M'Ling are watching him silently . CUT TO : EXT . THE FREIGHTER 'S RAIL – NIGHT Prendick stands beside Montgomery on the quarterdeck , staring up at the awesome canopy of stars overhead . Montgomery passes him a smoldering joint . MONTGOMERY Try some of this . Prendick waves it away . MONTGOMERY I guarantee it . I grew it myself . Prendick takes it out of good manners but declines to smoke it . He casts an eye over Montgomery 's crumpled outfit , the unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt , bare feet , gold cross around his neck and a portion of a `` Princeton Flag '' , tattooed on his chest . PRENDICK I have n't seen many Princeton tattoos . MONTGOMERY Yeah , it 's not the ivy league thing . Maybe that 's why I did it . Montgomery looks at him , at the joint he 's still holding . MONTGOMERY You ’ re supposed to smoke that thing . PRENDICK ( handing back the joint ) I remember a post game party at Harvard ... I was taken suddenly drunk and I begged a Radcliff senior to carve her initials on my chest ... MONTGOMERY ( brightly ) Silver spooner , right ? PRENDICK Well , I was n't on a scholarship . MONTGOMERY I can always tell . When we fished you out of the water , I could smell the money on you . Old money . The best kind ! The nose knows ... What did you study ? PRENDICK I got a degree in Humanities . MONTGOMERY Humanities ? Is n't that a licence to jerk off ? PRENDICK ( Laughing ) No . I had law school for that . Were you pre-med ? MONTGOMERY Biology . But that was a long time ago . He returns his attention to the sea . PRENDICK Listen , you know ... you saved my life ... MONTGOMERY ( recoiling ) I would n't get choked up about it . PRENDICK Yeah , well , thanks . In any case I owe you my thanks . MONTGOMERY You do n't owe me anything . You lucked out . I happened to be bored that day ... looking for a little action . If I 'd been feeling differently , you 'd still be out there . I 'd have stood here and waved you bye-bye . PRENDICK That 's Bullshit . MONTGOMERY Believe whatever you 've got to believe . I know you liberals need your little fairy tales . The two men look awkwardly away from each other . PRENDICK How did you happen to come out here ? MONTGOMERY You know , Eddie , I see us more like ships that pass in the night ... not assholes who meet on a plane and tell each other the story of their lives . PRENDICK ( shrugs ) Whatever . They lapse into awkward silence . MONTGOMERY Ever get yourself in real trouble ? Montgomery gives him a look of anticipation . PRENDICK I helped draft the constitution for a small African nation . There was a coup ... My staff and I were held hostage by a warlord . They shot one of us each day ... Six people . MONTGOMERY But not you . You 're a survivor . PRENDICK So far . But it 's not over . MONTGOMERY Sure it is . You 'll be back in the States eating at Rodney Rockets and I 'll be ... PRENDICK On your island Paradise . MONTGOMERY ( smiles ) Paradise . That 's Moreau 's dream alright . PRENDICK Moreau ? MONTGOMERY Man I work for . He once did for me what I did for you . PRENDICK Pulled you out of a lifeboat ? MONTGOMERY Pulled me out and asked no questions . Anyway it 's a boring little story and it 's not like you and me are friends . PRENDICK We could be . MONTGOMERY Would n't work . PRENDICK Why 's that ? MONTGOMERY 'Cause it 's plain as the nose on your face that you think I 'm crazy . Montgomery throws the joint into the sea and Prendick turns away , his eyes lighting now on the dark shape of M ’ Ling , who is leaning over the taffrail . M'Ling turns towards him for an instant , his eyes glowing a pale luminous green in the light of the wheelhouse . DISSOLVE TO : EXT . THE SOUTH PACIFIC - DAWN There is a CLATTER of chains and a tortured , hydraulic WHINING followed by a scarcely human clamor of SHOUTS AND GRUNTS as a cage holding a frightened black leopard is hoisted skyward by a crude rig of chain and cable , spinning in the air above the rising sun . CUT TO : INT . THE CABIN - DAWN Prendick wakes from an uneasy slumber and sits up in his bunk , rubbing his head , hearing HOARSE SHOUTING and PATTERING FEET overhead . As he gets to his feet there is a violent CREAKING SOUND and the freighter lists uneasily . CUT TO : EXT . THE DECK - DAWN As Prendick comes up the ladder , the first thing he sees is the flushed sky and the rising sun over the broad back and red hair of the Captain who stands , arms upraised , while above him the black leopard spins in its cage . DAVIS I do n't give a shit ! Off load all of them . Now , we 'll have a clean ship ! Prendick pushes past him and Davis turns with a start , staring drunkenly at him . DAVIS Hullo ... why , it 's Mister ... Mister ? PRENDICK Prendick . DAVIS Mr. Prawn-dick . You too . You 're off my ship . PRENDICK ( shocked ) What do you mean ? Off where ? DAVIS Where do you think ? Back into the sea , that's where . Plenty of room for you there ... PRENDICK Wait a minute , you ca n't ... DAVIS ( rolling his eyes ) Oh Mother , here we go again . Mr. Prawn-dick's telling me what I can and ca n't do on my own ship . My own ship ! Prendick looks past Davis and sees the island for the first time , the jagged crest of a submerged mountain rising sheer from the ocean , its flanks covered with palm trees and dense scrub , a thin streamer of smoke rising from the treetops . A large motor launch lies under the lee of the freighter and it is into this that the SAILORS are busy loading the last of the caged animals . M'Ling is already aboard the launch , helping three brutish-looking BOATMEN with the staghounds while Montgomery stands on the gangway talking with a NEWCOMER dressed in slightly grey white flannels and a battered Panama hat . The man 's blazing eyes stern expression and long grey hair and beard remind Prendick of a prophet out of the Old Testament . DAVIS Right this way , Mister ! PRENDICK Fuck you . I 'm not getting off here . Get away from me ... He looks to Montgomery . MONTGOMERY ( to the captain ) Take him to Moresby , he 'll pay you . DAVIS He can swim . MONTGOMERY Look , I 'll pay you . DAVIS I do n't want your money ... I piss on your money . Montgomery looks at Moreau who says nothing . He shouts back to Davis . MONTGOMERY You 'll have to take him . He ca n't come here . PRENDICK ( desperate ) Montgomery ! For Christ 's sake ! Montgomery , already boarding the launch , nods towards Moreau as if to indicate that he is powerless to intervene . MONTGOMERY Eddie , I 'm really sorry . Prendick glances around to see that he is loosely ringed now by belligerent-looking sailors . Two of the sailors take him by the arms and he begins to struggle . PRENDICK God damn it , get your hands off me ! He pulls free from the sailors and hits one of them hard enough to land him on the deck . Before he can go for the other one , several more are on him . The decked sailor rises and hits him in the stomach . DAVIS Adios , Mr. Prawn-dick . Give my regards to the U.N ... Great work you people are doing ... I really hold you in awe .... Davis laughs maniacally as Prendick , doubled over , is hauled , still struggling , to the gangway , but the launch is fully laden now and shoves off hastily . A broadening gap of green water appears beneath Prendick who pushes back with all his strength now , trying to grab hold of the ship 's rail . Stronger hands pry loose his fingers and he plunges from the ship . Bubbles explode around him and he goes under for a moment before kicking his way back to the surface , gasping at the sudden shock of the water . Above him he sees the steep side of the freighter , already starting to come about , its engines throbbing , Davis standing at the rail still shouting unintelligible abuse at him . He turns and strikes out for the island , trying to distance himself from the ship 's propellers . Then , with relief , he sees that the launch has turned back towards him . As the launch draws nearer he is able to make out the figure of Moreau sitting cramped up with the dogs in the bow staring fixedly but not without kindness at him , M'Ling 's face watching him intently from the stern . The launch comes alongside him and the three brutish boatmen haul him awkwardly aboard where he crouches shivering , glancing around uneasily at his rescuers . There is something strange about the features of the boatmen . They seem to be of some queer , brown-skinned race , their elfin faces peering out at him from beneath dirty turbans , lank black hair almost like horse hair framing their bright eyes . As he meets their gaze , first one and then the other turn away from him in a deferential manner . Moreau smiles at him . MOREAU ( over the engines ) I could n't let you drown , could I ? I had no idea he 'd really throw you in . Moreau turns away and looks to the crates . Looking up , Prendick catches Montgomery 's eyes as the launch comes about once more and starts back towards the island . He is serious , even grim . MONTGOMERY This was n't my idea . Remember that . There is a soberness to Montgomery 's voice that only deepens Prendick 's unease as he turns his attention towards the approaching beach . Prendick turns towards Moreau as if to speak , but the Doctor fixes him with a look , part smile , part warning , and Prendick says nothing . CUT TO : EXT . THE ISLAND - DAY Several LOCALS have assembled on the narrow jetty to meet the launch , some of them hopping up and down in undisguised excitement . One of the boathands throws a rope ashore and the launch cuts its engines and makes fast . Prendick steps ashore , looking dazedly about himself as the boatmen begin to unload , jabbering excitedly in their curious guttural voices , Montgomery and Moreau shouting the occasional command above the clamor of the staghounds . The island has the immediate lush beauty of all tropical Pacific islands . Birds call melodically from the surrounding lush vegetation , giving one the impression that life teems just beyond view . Prendick hears the SOUND of a grumbling engine and looks up to see a battered military flatbed come bouncing down the narrow track that connects the jetty with a fenced compound on the ridge overlooking the beach . At the center of the compound is an old colonial-style building and a cluster of Nissan huts painted in a manner reminiscent of either camouflage or Aboriginal art . Beyond the roofs of the Nissan huts Prendick can see the top of a radio mast and two rusting satellite dishes . The main house is surrounded by a wide lawn enclosed by an electric fence . At the bottom of the lawn is a wooden rostrum overlooking the compound gate and a flagpole from the top of which flies the emblem of the Tree of Life . M'Ling passes him now , bearing a packing case and talking enthusiastically with one of his fellow BEARERS , a man with oddly doglike features who wears a white jacket . He looks again to the beach and sees Moreau approaching him , his expression benign but formal . MOREAU I regret we really have no facilities for guests , but we can feed you . You look like you could use some breakfast . PRENDICK I wo n't be here for long . I 'm overdue as it is . MOREAU Yes , Montgomery told me you work for the UN ... a lawyer . Fascinating . I know very little of law myself . PRENDICK Once I call I 'm sure they 'll send a boat or a plane . MOREAU Yes , unfortunately at the moment our COMSAT equipment is down , but we 're working on it . He looks absently out to sea . MOREAU Since the ozone layer started going , we 've had communication problems . Something about magnetic storms ... I 'm a biologist , I do n't really understand electronics . M'Ling returns now , having loaded his burden onto the parked flatbed . He kneels beside Moreau . M'LING Father ... I am so glad to see you again . Moreau pats M'Ling 's arm and then incredibly the manservant takes the doctor 's hand and kisses it . MOREAU Yes , M'Ling . I 'm glad to see you too . M'LING Father ... I have seen the strangest things out there ... So confusing ... MOREAU Yes , M'Ling , You must tell me all about it . The doctor glances back at Prendick , who is watching . To make the scene complete , in the background , a few of these strange men are holding a softball practise ; one of them bats the ball to the others , who race around clumsily trying to catch it . Moreau 's eyes wander across the curious islanders , fixing now on the man in the white coat . MOREAU I 'd better get busy . Azazello , see what Mr. Prendick would like for breakfast . ( Glancing back at Prendick ) Oh , and I have to ask that you restrict yourself to the main house . It 's because of our insurance coverage . The people who fund us are afraid you might twist your ankle and sue us . PRENDICK ( smiles ) Unfortunately , it 's a litigious world . MOREAU Yes , I 'm sure you know all about that . We hear the crack of a bat and happy shouting . PRENDICK Are these people native to this island ? ( off Moreau 's look ) They 're very unusual looking . MOREAU Yes , many areas of the Pacific have very limited gene pools . Moreau moves off as Azazello approaches Prendick , awaiting his order . AZAZELLO Sair , you want breakfast ? PRENDICK Uhm ... two eggs ... some bacon ... AZAZELLO ( snickering nastily ) No bacon here . No eggs . PRENDICK Then whatever there is ... Some fruit ? AZAZELLO Fruit and granola ? PRENDICK Fine . Azazello grins with inappropriate good humor . AZAZELLO Yaba daba doo ! Azazello turns away and follows Moreau toward the big house passing the rest of the group who are loading the flatbed now with the caged animals from the boat . Montgomery , who has been supervising the islanders , breaks away from his work and comes over to Prendick . MONTGOMERY So ... You okay ? PRENDICK Yeah , and thanks once again you saved my life . MONTGOMERY Well that depends on how you look at it . I ’ d watch myself if I were you . Strictly eyes down , know what I mean ? PRENDICK ( shrugs ) He seems nice enough . MONTGOMERY ( suddenly serious ) He 's one of the greatest men alive . He pauses for a moment , then changes tack . MONTGOMERY Give me a hand with these , will you ? He crouches beside one of the crates stacked near the end of the jetty and lifts it . Indicating another , Prendick lifts it and follows Montgomery a short distance from the jetty where he sets his burden down in a clump of brush on the beach near some hastily constructed hutches and the rusting remains of pickup truck . Montgomery opens one of the crates and starts removing white rabbits and putting them into the hutch . MONTGOMERY They 're for the black leopard . Damned cat will eat better than I do . ( off Prendick ) Did n't you see the old man 's earth shoes ? I 'm a protein freak stuck with a fanatical vegetarian . PRENDICK None of the other animals are eaten ? MONTGOMERY Seal your lips at the thought ... Montgomery opens another of the crates . Several animals bolt out the open door and escape . He and Prendick grab for them but they make it to the surrounding jungle . MONTGOMERY Alright little ones , `` Go ye forth and multiply ... Born to fuck , and they 're so-o-o cute ... Montgomery returns his attention to the crate . Reaching in he removes the last rabbit , a large buck . The animal kicks and struggles in an attempt to join the others who have fled . Montgomery kneels , letting the rabbits feet touch the ground . He strokes the animal and calms it . MONTGOMERY Lusting for those runaway bunnies , big guy ? With a conspiratorial smile he looks at Prendick . MONTGOMERY Think this fellow 'd be missed ? Thinking Montgomery plans to release the rabbit , Prendick smiles , shrugs . PRENDICK Who 's to know ? MONTGOMERY Right , who 's to know . With a quick twist Montgomery breaks the rabbits neck . The animal screams and dies . Prendick reacts . MONTGOMERY ( off Prendick 's look ) What , you do n't like barbecued bunny ? CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - DAY The flatbed inches its way back up the hill , laden down with a deadweight of cages and packing cases . Prendick stands on the back of the truck as they pass an area where jungle borders the sides of the road . Among the trees he sees several spectacularly beautiful tropical birds , which seem totally unafraid , only curious at his passing . As they drive beneath a low bough , a large Bank 's Cockatoo dips his head in a friendly gesture , causing Prendick to extend his hand , returning a gesture of friendship . Clearing the jungle they reach the clearing and pass a main gate and a pipe corral where a grey-white thoroughbred crops at grass . Further on Prendick is able to get a closer view of magnifiscent bright green aloes that surround the big house . As they pass close by one of the plants he can hear a low TRILLING SOUND emanating from its fleshy , tendrilled branches that seem to quiver in the breeze even when Prendick can feel no breeze . The flatbed winds around the side of the big house and pulls up in a shady courtyard . Montgomery ushers Prendick into the house . CUT TO : INT . THE HOUSE – DAY Prendick finds himself in a large hall-turned-dining area , its walls lined with bookshelves and specimen cases . Montgomery hesitates for a moment in the doorway . MONTGOMERY Stay here . And I mean , stay right here . I won't be long . ( calls out ) Moreau . He leaves Prendick who wanders the library . As his gaze wanders over a series of old photos , Moreau in his thirties with an attractive woman , both holding the reins of their horses while the wind whips their hair in some wilderness setting . In another , Moreau embraces a conductor and first violinist beside a piano on a concert stage . While Montgomery can be heard calling `` Moreau '' off screen , Prendick examines a row of framed academic certificates hanging beside a row of crucified butterflies and Da Vinci anatomical sketches . One yellowing certificate is from the Nobel Committee , beneath it set against blue velvet is a medallion , the prize . Somewhere in the background a song is heard from a CD player , the same love ballad heard in the opening scene . Prendick turns slowly , drawn towards the source of the music . On the far side of the room an open doorway leads through a small , densely planted arboretum to a sun drenched veranda facing the sea . Through it , beyond the foreground foliage , Prendick glimpses a figure moving gently to the music . A beautiful young woman , barefoot and clad in a sarong , turning slowly in a puddle of sunlight . Her eyes are closed , her only audience a bright green parrot watching from its perch at the far end of the veranda . Transfixed , Prendick moves towards her . He stops amidst the foliage of the arboretum , taken by a sudden reverie . Something moves in the dense verdure near his head . Prendick turns to see a pair of disturbingly human eyes set in a wizened face , belonging to a small arboreal creature about the size of a large galago or lorus that peers from the foliage . Prendick 's curiosity elicits an sudden aggressive response . Teeth bared , the creature threatens with a rasping growl and a terrierlike snap , causing Prendick to take a quick step back . As he regains his composure he hears a young woman 's laugh . Prendick turns . The dancer , a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN , barefoot and clad in a sarong , faces him from a few feet away . At his glance her smile quickly fades to something akin to fear . Prendick sees now that she has the same unusual tan as the islanders while her high , vaguely oriental cheekbones and light green eyes give her a somewhat feline cast further enhanced by the slightest deformation of her upper lip , as if she has had a harelip surgically corrected in childhood . PRENDICK Is it some kind of pet ? He takes a step towards her . Like a child who has spoken out of turn , she demurs and backs away . Prendick raises his hands to show he means no harm . PRENDICK Wait , it 's all right ... AISSA Who are you ? PRENDICK I just got here . She looks questioningly at him , still apprehensive . PRENDICK This morning . I came on the boat . AISSA Did the doctor bring you ? PRENDICK Yes . AISSA Have you come from the sea ? PRENDICK I come from New York . AISSA ( brightly ) Oh yes , New York ! That is another island ! PRENDICK That 's right , it is . She looks intently at Prendick's'hands , then holds up her own hands , counting her fingers . AISSA One ... two ... three ... four ... five ! You 're a Five Man ! Prendick looks at her in bewilderment . PRENDICK My name 's Edward Prendick . AISSA Pren-Dick . PRENDICK Pren-dick . She kneels suddenly before him and , taking his hand , presses it to her lips in a curious form of greeting . AISSA You have small hands . It is good . He looks with real interest at Aissa , and at that moment there comes something like a low GROWL from behind him . He turns to see Azazello and M'Ling ( who has changed into white coat ) emerge from the study with his breakfast and a steaming pot of coffee on two serving trays . Aissa draws away from them . AZAZELLO Your breakfast , Sair . PRENDICK Put it ... uh ... out here . AZAZELLO Yes , Sair . Azazello and M'Ling lay his breakfast on a nearby table while Aissa keeps a cautious distance . There is an unmistakable tension between her and Azazello . Prendick sits down and pours himself a coffee , motioning for Aissa to join him once M'Ling and Azazello have withdrawn to the study . PRENDICK Please , sit down . Will you have some coffee ? She shakes her head , and seats herself opposite him , peering in undisguised fascination at his face and hands . AISSA Your hands are so beautiful . Prendick is charmed by this , amused , and quite turned on . PRENDICK Thanks . No one 's ever noticed them before . Azazello peers in at them once , furtively , from the study door . Aissa does n't see him , but bristles slightly , knowing he 's there . PRENDICK Are you from this island ? AISSA My father brought me here when I was very young . PRENDICK Where are you from originally ? AISSA Father says I was born in Suva . PRENDICK Will you tell me your name ? She looks away shyly , raising her hands to her mouth . Then M'Ling calls her from the study , inadvertently answering Prendick 's question . M'LING ( O.S . ) Aissa ! Aissa shoots Prendick a swift , somewhat coquettish glance . AISSA They need me now . I have to rehearse . PRENDICK Rehearse what ? AISSA Alice in Wonderland . I 'm Alice . She slips away , her movements swift yet strangely graceful , her bare feet making scarcely a sound as she pads across the verandah . Prendick looks after her , fascinated . Exiting through the study door she almost collides with Montgomery , who glances amusedly from her to Prendick , a smoldering joint poised between his thumb and forefinger . MONTGOMERY Well , I see we 're getting acquainted . ( He sighs . ) Lovely thing , little Aissa . Montgomery offers the joint to Prendick , who declines it . PRENDICK I saw the awards ... a Nobel Prize . MONTGOMERY Moreau 's a famous name in genetics . Or infamous , depending on who you listen to . PRENDICK Why infamous ? MONTGOMERY He 's a genius , so everybody who 's not a genius hates his guts ... Most scientific research is totally motivated by jealousy and greed . And vanity ... do n't want to forget vanity . He came out here to escape that . PRENDICK How long has he been on this island ? MONTGOMERY Eighteen years . The animal rights boobies drove him to it . Got so in the States you couldn't cage a rat without reading him his rights . PRENDICK And you ? MONTGOMERY Almost ten years for me . He offers the joint to Prendick . PRENDICK No , thanks . PRENDICK ( cautious ) Listen , Montgomery ... MONTGOMERY ( not liking the tone ) What ? PRENDICK Your assistant , M'Ling . There 's something kind of ... His ears are strange ... they 're sort of pointed . MONTGOMERY What ? ? Pointed ears ? ? You 're shitting me ... PRENDICK So what is he , a Vulcan ? MONTGOMERY No , and , I think it 's incredibly insensitive of you to bring it up . How would you like it if someone made remarks about your ears ? PRENDICK And the guy who brought my breakfast acts very weird . What is it , they do n't like their wages ? MONTGOMERY What are you suddenly , Amnesty International ? Trust me . No one complains . Montgomery offers the joint . Prendick waves it off . MONTGOMERY No ? You 're missing out . Back when we dabbled in plant genes I created this . Like everything else on this Island some serious method went into this shit . Montgomery 's expression hardens noticeably and he stands now , motioning for Prendick to follow him . MONTGOMERY Come on , man . I think it 's time I showed you your room . PRENDICK God damn it , Montgomery ... Talk to me ! MONTGOMERY Sssh ! ... Dig it ... Prendick joins Montgomery in the study door to see M'Ling and Aissa sitting at one end of the room , reading determinedly from Lewis Carrol . AISSA '' And thou hast slain the Jabberwock ? Come to my arms , my beamish boy O Frabjous day ! Callooh ! Callay ! '' He chortled in his joy . Prendick looks across at Aissa and their gaze meets for an instant before she returns her eyes to the page , reading artlessly aloud , placing odd stresses on phrases that were never meant to be stressed . AISSA 'Twas brillig and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble on the wabe ; All mimsy were the borogroves , and the mome raths outgrabe . As she finishes M'Ling crosses to her holding his hands like a rabbit and mustering a rabbit like expression in his face . AISSA ( acting anxious ) Oh , Rabbit , it 's so hard to understand , but it seems somebody killed something . M'Ling mimes removing a watch from his vest . M'LING By my ears and whiskers I 'm late , I 'm late . The Duchess will be in such a state ... MONTGOMERY ( affectionately ) What a crew . Ya got ta love 'em . Prendick lingers for an instant , fixing on Aissa . Montgomery glances back noting his expression . CUT TO : INT . THE GUEST ROOM - DAY Montgomery leads Prendick across the hall to the open door of a small apartment , plainly but comfortably furnished . Some clothes have been laid out for Prendick , and there is a filled bookshelf , which Prendick studies for a moment . There is a low bed in the darkest corner of the room shrouded in mosquito netting and a small barred window looking out towards the sea . PRENDICK Barred windows ... You do n't trust the locals ? MONTGOMERY You do n't like your room ? PRENDICK What 's the update on the COMSAT equipment ? MONTGOMERY Not my area of expertise . At that moment a third figure appears in the doorway . An agitatedlooking ISLANDER dressed in a surgical smock . WAGGDI Mr. Montgomery , Sir , you must come at once . The contractions have started . MONTGOMERY Thank you , Waggdi . I 'm on my way . ( To Prendick ) Oh Christ , here we go again . He steps lightly out of the room , drawing the door shut behind him . Just before it closes Prendick catches a glimpse of Montgomery's face through the narrowing crack . MONTGOMERY Sorry about this , Eddie . Prendick starts towards him but Montgomery closes the door in his face and he hears the SOUND OF A KEY being turned . PRENDICK Hey , Montgomery . C'mon , open the damn door . MONTGOMERY It 's for your own good . Prendick rattles the door furiously . PRENDICK Come on , Montgomery . If it 's about the damned insurance I 'll sign a waver . Shit ! He turns to face the room , the barred window , the brilliant sunlight and the green fans of the trees beyond . Suddenly , a piercing howl of pain comes from somewhere outside . Prendick 's eyes search the surrounding jungle for the source , but there is nothing . CUT TO : INT . THE GUEST ROOM - DUSK ( A LITTLE LATER ) Prendick sits on the bed , glancing through a pile of dog-eared magazines that are on the table beside the bed . As he takes another TIME , he reacts to the cover . A picture of Moreau surrounded by a tableau of helixes and medallions with profiles of Nobel . We see him flip through the pages to the article which is headlined : `` Moreau , Future hopes ... or fears ? '' Prendick tries to read as the howl comes again followed by others . Some creature in agony , perhaps closer to death than before as they build to such an exquisite expression of suffering that it is as though all the pain in the world had found a single voice . He drops the magazine and goes to the window . As he looks out into the crepuscular gloom of the jungle , the howls diminish and gradually stop . Prendick goes to the bed and lies down , releived by the returned silence of the approaching night . Through drifting mosquito netting , DISSOLVE TO : We see the following ( PRENDICK 'S P.0.V ) as though through a nightmare : Prendick is alone , deep in sleep , through which he can hear the SCREAMS , now at an unbearable pitch . INT . THE WOMB - NIGHT An unborn CHILD pushes through the red-veined darkness , eyes still closed , squeezed shut as if anguished by this transition from one world to another . In the darkness of the womb the child twists and SCREAMS . CUT TO : INT . THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT Prendick sits bolt upright on the bed . It takes him only a moment to realize that the pitch of the cries has changed . They no longer sound like the howling of man nor beast , but have become instead the screams of a child in pain . Prendick turns and goes to the door a bit unsteadily . He tries it . Still locked . Kneeling down , he examines the old style lock . In reaction to something he 's seen , he reaches to a hat stand beside the door and removes a wire coat hanger . Quickly bending it , he pokes it into the lock and works it around . A few thrusts and he forces the key out the other side . It clangs on the hallway floor . Making a hook out of one end of the hanger , he slides it under the door and draws it back with the key . The screaming subsides as Prendick unlocks the door and opens it . After a beat of hesitation he exits into the empty hallway . CUT TO : INT . DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - PRE-DAWN Prendick comes down a stairway into the empty gloom of the house . He moves along toward a large window that opens off the hallway . Peering out , Prendick sees -EXT . A KITCHEN COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN In the dim light of morning , Azazello is cutting up the skinned and gutted rabbit which bears a disturbing resemblance to the fetus of Prendick 's nightmare . The kitchen courtyard is an area nearly touched by the surrounding growth of the jungle . As Azazello works he reacts to an animal movement in the surrounding brush . A vague shadowy face appears , staring at the preparation of the meat . AZAZELLO Get away ! Azazello pitches a stone . The face disappears and the creature retreats noisily into the brush . INT . HALLWAY - PRE-DAWN Another scream is heard from outside the hduse and Prendick moves on . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - JUST BEFORE DAWN Prendick stands in the lighted doorway of the big house for a moment , realizing now that the cries are coming from the lighted complex of Nissan huts across the yard . PRENDICK Moreau ! As he starts toward the huts Aissa emerges from the shadows of the porch . Knowing his purpose , she takes his arm . AISSA Oh no , please ! You ca n't ! PRENDICK That 's a child screaming ! AISSA It 's forbidden to go there ! PRENDICK What the hell are they doing ? Someone 's being tortured . Prendick starts towards the source of the screams , breaking free of Aissa , who does not dare to follow him further . Behind the house , he stumbles across the pile of baseball equipment ; gloves , a catcher 's mask , some bats . He grabs a bat and goes on . AISSA No Prendick ! You ca n't go there ! It 's the House of Pain ! CUT TO : INT . THE LABORATORY - JUST BEFORE DAWN Prendick 's entrance is drowned out by the clamoring of caged animals , going mad with fear at the sound of the screaming child . He stalks slowly down an aisle between the cages , baseball bat raised , looking around in the light of the naked bulbs overhead , noting the occupants of the cages . Dogs , monkeys , big and small cats and in the last of the cages the black leopard , lying on its side and panting as if desperately ill . He sees movement up ahead and his knuckles whiten on the handle of the bat . Beyond the cages is a laboratory area , a maze of computer consoles and arcane apparatus linked by suspended tubes and cabling to a row of glass tanks and glowing incubators . At the far end of the laboratory area a group of figures in stained surgical smocks are ringed about an eccentric , custom-built operating table . The figures shift slightly and for a moment Prendick catches a glimpse of hairy legs that might be human fastened to raised steel stirrups that have more in common with medieval torture than obstetrics . Then Moreau , completely absorbed , watches as Montgomery draws a vinyl sheet across a body , obscuring it from view . Moreau turns from the table and Prendick sees at last where the cries are coming from . Moreau is cradling a screaming mutant child in his arms . A wriggling , squalling thing , more dog than man , umbilical cord still dangling from its distended belly , eyes already open and hideously aware . Prendick staggers back with a groan and Moreau catches sight of him , his face growing white and terrible . PRENDICK ( shuddering ) Oh , my God ! Montgomery sees him . MONTGOMERY Oh shit ... Montgomery starts forward , trying to come between Prendick and Moreau . Prendick takes a defensive stance with the bat . PRENDICK Stay the hell away from me ! MONTGOMERY Whatever you think is going on here , you're wrong . PRENDICK You sick bastards . Prendick retreats toward the exit , brandishing the bat to keep them at bay . He backs into a large assemblage of tubes and glass retorts which crashes to the floor . Monkeys shriek and animal sound erupt from all sides as Prendick , totally freaked , beats a retreat to the door . CUT TO : EXT . COMPOUND - DAWN As Prendick backs out the door he is touched from behind by Aissa who startles him . He spins and nearly swings on her with the bat . She cowers . Prendick reaches out and takes her wrist . Aissa stares at him wide eyed as he pulls her away from the lab . CUT TO : INT . THE LABORATORY - DAWN Moreau places the mutant infant on a scale . He speaks to Montgomery . MONTGOMERY He 's freaked . You 'll have to talk him down . MOREAU ( nods ) Find him . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - DAWN Prendick leads Aissa to an area of tropical overgrowth near the main house . PRENDICK Listen , you 've got to help me . I have to get away from here ! AISSA I ca n't help you ! You 've broken the Law ! PRENDICK I 've broken the law ? ? ? What law ? AISSA I do n't know what to do . He 's my father ! I'm afraid ... She takes Prendick 's hand , holds it . PRENDICK Just show me the way out of here and I 'll take care of you . I promise . Aissa looks with terrible confusion at the house . PRENDICK Aissa , there 's no time ... They 'll be coming after me . Aissa grabs his hand . They break into a run . Aissa stops and turns once , looking back at the house with some incredible longing . Then she runs on . Montgomery comes dashing out of the laboratory and tries to intercept them , but Prendick swings the baseball bat at his face and he ducks out of the way , stumbles back and falls . MONTGOMERY Eddie ! Come on , do n't be an asshole ! I 'll tell you what it 's all about . Prendick keeps running , following Aissa past the singing aloes towards the dark wall of the rain forest . MONTGOMERY Come back ! I 'm warning you man , there 's some really unstable phenomena out there . Aissa leads Prendick to a section of the fence where the trees have invaded the compound and he sees a jagged gap in the wire mesh , hidden from the house by luxuriant foliage . He starts through the hole , pinning back a loose flap of the fence with the handle of the baseball bat . CUT TO : EXT . THE RAINFOREST - EARLY MORNING The forest is so dense that after going only a few yards the compound is already lost from Prendick 's sight . AISSA Where can we go ? They 'll find us . PRENDICK We have to get to the launch . AISSA To the sea ? You 'll take me with you ? Prendick looks at her for a moment . PRENDICK Yes . AISSA To New York ? Prendick almost smiles at her innocence . PRENDICK Yes . New York . They reach the edge of the forest now and through the trees Prendick can see the dawn coming up over the sparkling ocean . Up ahead , the beach seems deserted save for two sleeping ISLANDERS who lie some way off beside the smoking embers of a campfire . Prendick slows , looking cautiously around his eyes fixed on the jetty and the launch bobbing at its moorings . PRENDICK We 'll need fuel to make it to the shipping lane . Do you know where they keep the Diesel ? Aissa points toward a storage shed well back from the water . AISSA In that shed . Prendick A TANNOY a diesel starting is about to start towards the shed when the SOUND OF comes drifting down the beach followed by the low GROWL of engine . The two sleeping figures beside the camp stir now , to their feet and coming to attention . PRENDICK Shit . He draws back into the undergrowth as the flatbed comes rattling down the track from the big house , Montgomery standing in the back , a loud hailer in one hand . The flatbed pulls up beside the jetty , disgorging a host of doglike FIGURES carrying electric cattle prods . They fan out across the beach , the rising sun at their backs while Montgomery bark instructions to them through the loud hailer . MONTGOMERY The Man from the Sea has broken the Law ! Find him for me and bring him back ! The two figures beside the campfire prostrate themselves on the sand , crying out in unison . ONLOOKERS Back to the House of Pain , Master ! To the House of Pain ! Aissa tugs urgently at Prendick 's shoulder and he turns , following her deeper into the forest . PRENDICK Is there anywhere we can hide ? AISSA The village . The men there will know what to do . PRENDICK Who are they ? Do they work for Moreau ? AISSA They are good . You can trust them . Still not totally convinced he can trust her , Prendick follows Aissa , weaving through the undergrowth as they climb the flank of a densely forested ridge . Prendick glances around at the vegetation , the rustling and scurrying of myriad unseen lives . They emerge from the trees onto the bank of a shallow stream and Aissa freezes suddenly in fear . A naked MAN , his skin covered in patches of spotted fur , crouches on all fours beside the stream , supping up water like an animal . He senses their presence and glances up guiltily , his eyes going at once to Prendick . He starts to his feet , wiping his mouth , and Prendick sees his lips are rimmed with blood . Prendick takes a step towards him , looking him steadfastly in the eye , clutching the baseball bat with both his hands . LO-MAI No ! He turns and goes bounding away through the undergrowth . Prendick , startled , looks back now to see Aissa sniffing the air , her brow furrowed , a curious far-off look in her eyes . He follows her gaze , seeing a trail of bright crimson drops dotting the foliage . The trail leads to the body of a dead rabbit , its remains wedged in the fork of a tree . It is one of the rabbits from the beach but it has been savagely mutilated , the carcass glistening with flies . Aissa glances back at Prendick , her face growing solemn . AISSA He 's a bad one , that man . He 's broken the Law . He 's going back to the House of Pain . A staghound BAYS from somewhere behind them and Prendick glances at her uneasily . Aissa darts forward once more , beckoning for him to follow her . She sets off swiftly through the trees , moving at such a quick pace that Prendick has to struggle hard to keep up with her . AISSA Quicker , you have to run . At length they come to an open space in the forest and Aissa pauses once more to let him catch up . Ahead in the center of the glade surrounding the fungoid ruins of a huge , fallen tree are THREE TAILED FIGURES , more like attenuated sloths walking on their hind legs than men , their naked bodies covered in a fine silvery fur , their long necks surmounted by odd chinless faces and eyes like dark pools of honey . They are engaged in picking some kind of fruit , pulling down prickly husks from the trees and scooping out the fleshy contents . Prendick looks questioningly at Aissa . AISSA The Silent Ones . They were the first of his children but he did n't give them speech . Prendick is about to return his attention to the creatures in the clearing when a FIGURE in a bright Hawaiian shirt steps from the surrounding undergrowth . ASSASSIMON You ! You ! You ! You ! The furry figures in the glade take fright and go sloping off into the trees . Prendick turns to face the newcomer , a curiously simian individual with long forearms and a heavy brow overshadowing bright , curious eyes . ASSASSIMON You . In the boat . PRENDICK Right ... I came in the boat . ASSASSIMON You play ball with us now ? Prendick glances awkwardly at the bat he 's holding . ASSASSIMON Can you hit the ball ? PRENDICK ( going with it ) Sure , I batted two ninety three when I played for the Cards . ASSASSIMON It 's good . We need a power hitter very much to hit the long ball . ( Smiling conspiratorially ) I am the pitcher . My name is Assassimon . AISSA He 's a Five Man like you ! She takes Prendick 's hand and holds it out so Assassimon can see . Assassimon counts Prendick 's fingers carefully , holding out his own for comparison . ASSASSIMON It is very good ! We must tell Kiril ! He swings around , gesturing for them to follow and then goes trotting off , his hands hanging down and his jaw thrust forward . AISSA See , you 're alright here . You 'll be safe with me . Prendick turns to Aissa and takes her hand . CUT TO : EXT . THE SETTLEMENT - DAY Drawing nearer , Prendick sees that a small village of wooden shanties and lean-tos made from matted palm fans is hidden amidst the volcanic boulders . Several of the villagers come shambling from their hovels to watch them as they enter the ravine and a group of deformed , dog-like children follow jibing at their heels . The walls of the ravine shelter are a wasp 's nest of more complex mud-walled homes and it is into the doorway of one of those that Assassimon disappears . Prendick glances around , wrinkling his nose at the pungent odor . The ground is covered with decaying fruit pulp and other refuse and the air here is thick with smoke . Something brushes his leg and he starts violently down to see a dim pinkish thing resembling a flayed looking child pawing at his trousers . Assassimon reappears , and Aissa tugs him by the arm . AISSA Here . This is our home now . PRENDICK Oh great . Looks like the Hospitality Suite at the Bronx Zoo . She gives him an uncomprehending , almost hurt look . AISSA What is wrong ? PRENDICK ( melting ) Nothing . It 's fine . She leads him towards the shadowy aperture and he takes a deep breath . CUT TO : INT . KIRIL 'S DEN – DAY Prendick finds himself in a semi-circular space shaped like the half of a beehive . Rough vessels of lava and wood stand about the floor and one on a rough stool . In the darkest corner of the chamber sits a shapeless mass of darkness that GRUNTS as Prendick enters . KIRIL Hey ! Assassimon stands in the dim light of the doorway and holds out a split coconut to Prendick as he crawls into the other corner to crouch beside Aissa . The little pink Sloth Creature stands peering in from the aperture , and something else with a drab face and bright eyes comes to stare over its shoulder . KIRIL Hey ! ASSASSIMON It is a man ! Look , it is a man ! KIRIL Shut up . Kiril pulls himself upright , his head brushing the ceiling forcing him to hold his huge , bearish frame in a melancholic stoop . He peers short-sightedly down at Prendick who looks him in the eye in as friendly a manner as he can muster . Kiril rummages in the shadows beside his bed and produces a battered portable stereo . KIRIL You have batteries ? I need the Energizer . PRENDICK No ... I 'm sorry ... AISSA He 's new . He came on the ship . KIRIL Then you must learn the Law . PRENDICK That 's really not necessary . I 'm a lawyer and I ... KIRIL ( dismissive ) That way ... Kiril turns and motions towards a passageway leading deeper into the hillside . KIRIL Through there ... Go ! Prendick starts forward with trepidation . CUT TO : INT . THE CAVE - DAY With Kiril showing the way , they enter a corridor that widens and grows gradually brighter , letting out into a huge , natural chamber lit by a fissure open to the sky . The galleries of the cave are lined with crouching FIGURES , their eyes glinting in the half light , their outlines made hazy by the greasy smoke rising from the embers of a fire on the floor beyond . Prendick sees now that the walls of the cave are covered with elaborate paintings . Innumerable twisted stick figures dance across the rock faces , rising from four legs to two , from beast to man and encircling on the far wall a huge rendition of the Tree of Life , the spiralling ladder of the D.N.A . double helices . The bear man turns now towards Prendick , who stands awestruck . KIRIL This is the House of the Law . I am the Keeper of the Way . Only a few can ever enter here . Kiril takes down a conch shell that hangs beside the entrance and , placing it to his lips , blows a mighty BLAST , setting off a MURMURING that ripples throughout the cavern . A FIGURE appears now before the painted helices , stepping into the shaft of light that falls from the crevice high above . A bearded figure in a stained white suit and battered Panama hat who is holding a grisly fetish staff . PRENDICK Moreau ... He starts to raise the bat , but then sees that it is not the doctor after all . The suit is too filthy and the beard he now realizes is made from tufts of dyed hair affixed to a painted wooden mask . The mask , however , fails to disguise the two huge ram horns that curl from the sides of this grotesque head . SAYER OF THE LAW Who is there ? KIRIL A Five Man , from the sea ! He 's come to hear the Law ! At this , a sudden clamoring of pipes and drums comes from the gallery above and several of the shadowy figures closest to them turn towards Prendick , crowding around him , touching his hair and clothes , taking him by the hands and dragging him further into the chamber . A corpulent SOW LADY , her heavy thighs painted with grey mud , approaches him , draping a garland of wild flowers around his neck . She makes as if to embrace him , and he recoils in revulsion , as Aissa lashes out at her , forcing her to withdraw . AISSA Get away from him ! He 's mine ! Prendick looks back at her uneasily , catching an unmistakable feral gleam in her eyes . There is a lull in the clamoring and the Sayer of the Law calls attention by banging his fetish staff against the rocks . SAYER OF THE LAW Not to walk on all-fours ; that is the Law . Prendick says nothing ; Kiril nudges him firmly . KIRIL Say it . PRENDICK What ? KIRIL Repeat the law . PRENDICK ( annoyed ) Not to walk on all-fours . ( Then , after prompting from Kiril ) That is the Law . The crowd echoes his words and the ceremony begins . The Sayer of the Law intones the mad litany , line by line , and the crowd repeats it , swaying from side to side and beating their hands on their knees . ALL Not to walk on all-fours ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? Not to suck up drink ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? Not to eat flesh nor fish ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? Not to claw the bark of trees ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? Not to chase other men ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? Not to couple any which-way ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? Prendick is transfixed by this powerful and moving travesty of human ritual . He stares amazed as the crowd sways , faster and faster . There is a loud MUSICAL PUNCTUATION from the upper gallery and the chanting swings to a new formula . SAYER OF THE LAW The punishments of those who break the Law are terrible . None escape . ALL None escape . His is the House of Pain . His is the Hand that makes . His is the Hand that wounds . His is the Hand that heals . None escape ! Assassimon comes forward , as if to confess to the congregation . ASSASSIMON None escape ! See , I did a wrong thing once , it was a little thing ... I jabbered ... I stopped talking . No one could understand me . Look ! ( He holds out his hand . ) I am burned , branded here on the hand . And now I talk ! He is great ! He is good ! SAYER OF THE LAW Sooner or later , every one will want a thing that is bad . What you will want , we do not know . Some want to follow things that move , to watch and slink and spring , to kill and bite , bite deep and rich , sucking all the warm blood ... It is bad . Not to chase other men ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? Not to eat flesh nor fish , never ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? To couple only with one ; that is the Law . The congregation is hypnotized by the ritual of this . SAYER OF THE LAW Some go scratching at the graves of the dead , some go fighting with foreheads or claws , some bite suddenly without or warning , some go snuffing at the earth , some love uncleanness , some make wild and random fornications every which-way ... it is bad . ASSASSIMON None escape ! Suddenly , there the SOUND OF GUNFIRE is heard outside . A murmuring starts amongst those assembled and above their voices Prendick hears the distant BAYING of staghounds . ASSASSIMON He 's coming ! He ’ s coming ! There is a cacophonic CLASH OF PERCUSSION from the upper gallery and the entire congregation starts towards the door at once in a furry tumult of struggling , misshapen forms , almost trampling Prendick underfoot . He swiftly loses sight of Kiril and Aissa , allowing the crowd to suck him towards the door , hearing now the SOUND of the loud hailer come from somewhere outside . CUT TO : EXT . THE SETTLEMENT – DAY Prendick bursts blinking into the daylight , the last stragglers of the congregation still lurching past him to join the crowd that is gathering at the mouth of the canyon . Prendick pushes through them , peering over the hunched shoulders and pointed ears to see a nightmarish procession approaching . It is led by Moreau , cantering astride the horse , his awful face shadowed by the brim of his Panama hat , a bullwhip in his hands , a hunting rifle in a scabbard , the villagers supplicating themselves before him , throwing dust over their heads and laying palm fans before the horse 's hooves as he rides into the settlement . Moreau is flanked by a retinue of DOG MEN who carry whips as well as by M'Ling , Waggdi and Azazello , who control the leashes of the snarling staghounds . Montgomery walks sullenly behind them , a gun in one hand and the loud hailer in the other . Prendick turns to see that his way back through the canyon is blocked by more of the villagers . He ducks down , trying to hide himself in the crowd . Beyond the huts the wall of the rainforest is tantalizingly close yet hopelessly far away . Moreau is almost parallel with him now , his eyes like splinters of ice as he surveys the crowd . Behind him Montgomery raises the loud hailer . MONTGOMERY I know he 's in there . Better give him up . I mean now ! SAYER OF THE LAW Evil is he who breaks the Law ! MONTGOMERY And you know what happens when you break the law , do n't you ? You shaggy little fucker ... ALL ( CHORUS ) Back to the House of Pain ! Back to the House of Pain , Master ! MONTGOMERY You got it , boys and girls ... back to the House of Pain . Come on now . Where is he ? The villagers slowly turn their snouts towards Prendick who tries to make a run for it , dashing his shoulder into one clumsy figure and flinging him forward into another . The little pink Sloth Creature grasps at his legs and he delivers a savage blow to its face with the baseball bat . MOREAU STOP ! HOLD HIM ! He looks with incredible severity at Aissa . She looks imploringly back . AISSA Father , please ... Moreau smiles tenderly at her , then turns sharply away . Hands clutch at Prendick . He pitches headlong through the crowd and tackles Montgomery , both of them going down almost beneath the horse 's hooves , grappling desperately for the gun . MONTGOMERY God , Eddie , you 're turning into a real pain in the ass . We just want to ... Prendick strikes him on the jaw and , wrestling his fingers from the trigger guard , regains his feet just as the Dog Men come loping up to him , brandishing their cattle prods . He raises the gun , firing a round into the air . PRENDICK Back , You fucking freaks ! He fires another round and Moreau 's horse panics , rearing dangerously and causing the Dog Men to scatter . Prendick turns and makes a break for it , sprinting across a millet patch towards the shelter of the trees , where he turns and fires another shot , while Moreau struggles to get his horse back under control . CUT TO : EXT . THE RAINFOREST - DAY Prendick runs full tilt through the undergrowth , the automatic clutched in one hand , the air behind him filled with threatening cries and the baying of staghounds . He zig-zags through the trees , pausing and changing course as he hears BRANCHES CRACKING up ahead , then turning again as he hears Moreau and Montgomery SHOUTING from somewhere behind him and the NEIGHING of the horse . Some of the islanders are ROARING AND SCREAMING now like beasts of prey as they hurl themselves after him through the foliage , primitive cudgels clasped in their hands . As Prendick forces his way through the thick undergrowth of the forest , shadow figures brachiate through the trees above him . WHOOPING , HOWLING , GIBBON-LIKE BEAST MEN quickly overtake him and cut off his escape , menacing him from the canopy above . Prendick turns and fights through a tangled thicket of thorns toward a break in the trees . Breaking from the undergrowth which tears at his clothes , he reaches the edge of a narrow gully and falls headlong into the steaming waters of a murky , sulphurous stream . The gun falls into the muck . The sound of the pursuing dogs grows louder as he gets to his feet . Gasping with pain as the steaming mud clings to his flesh . Shoving his hands into the sulfureous mud to find the gun he is forced to withdraw them quickly before they are cooked by the viscous , almost boiling water . Suddenly , a HYENA-SWINE MAN breaks from the surrounding brush and , seeing Prendick , gives a loud roar . As the creature lunges into the mud Prendick stumbles away , bleeding profusely now from a wound in his scalp . The YELPING of the dogs and Dogmen and a CHATTERING AND A GIBBERING followed by the CRACK of a whip and VOICES . Prendick sets off again , splashing ankle deep through the scalding water , crying out to himself as he runs , seeing the blue line of the ocean now through the trees . CUT TO : EXT . BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON Prendick splashes across the delta and does not stop running until he is up to his knees in salt water , staring out at the setting sun and the unreachable horizon . He turns westward , stumbling along the water 's edge . Then , suddenly , far in front of him , he sees figures emerging from the rainforest . Moreau on his horse , then Montgomery , then some of the Dog Men with their snapping charges . They see him and begin advancing . Prendick starts to turn only to see a posse of villagers emerging from the tree line behind him to cut him off . He looks towards the horizon once more and , having nowhere else left , wades straight out into the water . Moreau addresses him from the water 's edge . Aissa stands beside him , frightened and confused . MOREAU Mr. Prendick , please ... There 's no escape from here . His eyes wander over the massed ranks , over Aissa and M'Ling , Waggdi and Azazello and further up the beach Assassimon , Kiril and the others . PRENDICK They were men ... But you 've mutilated them , made slaves of them . MOREAU That 's not it at all . You 've got it wrong . Prendick shouts at the gathering . PRENDICK Listen ! There 's a hundred of you , and two of them ! You have nothing to fear from them . You do n't need to obey ! MOREAU Prendick ! The islanders seem puzzled , staring wonderingly at Prendick . They edge closer to the tide line and Moreau cracks his whip , causing them to retreat once more . PRENDICK These men are n't gods ! You have the power to free yourselves . MONTGOMERY Back off , man . Do n't start something that might end in tears . Moreau moves his horse forward . When he is near Prendick he indicates the rifle in its saddle scabbard . MOREAU Mr. Prendick , this rifle is loaded . Please , take it . Prendick hesitates . MOREAU Take the rifle and put your mind at ease . We are not the enemy . It must n't appear that there's conflict between us . Cautiously , Prendick moves towards him and slips the rifle from the scabbard . He aims it at Moreau who nudges his horse closer . MOREAU ( whispering fiercely ) Those are not men . Do you understand me ? They're Chromatic hybrids ... experiments in a humanizing process . Do n't excite them or it could be bad for all of us . PRENDICK They 're animals ? MOREAU Please , Mr. Prendick , they 're not without sensitivity . Montgomery moves towards them ; Prendick swings the rifle to cover them both , but he comes slowly closer . MONTGOMERY Eddie , we hunted you for your own good . This island is full of ... unstable phenomena . MOREAU You might not have survived the night . PRENDICK That woman I saw on the operating table ... MOREAU You did n't see a woman . What you saw was not a human . You 're certainly entitled to ethical reservations about our research , but at least hear us out . MONTGOMERY C'mon Eddie , stop pointing that thing at my head . MOREAU We mean you no harm . Our only intention is to get you safely on your way . PRENDICK Oh , right ... but I suppose the COMSAT equipment is still down . MOREAU Yes , it is down . Do you want to know the reason ? There 's been a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan . We heard it on the short wave radio . Prendick is stricken . MOREAU All COMSAT communication is restricted to military usage . Prendick looks away at the distant sea , trying to imagine the world beyond the island . PRENDICK A war ? MOREAU So far it 's only the rumble of a distant storm , but it brings a new imperative to our survival ... to the work we do . CUT TO : INT . LABORATORY - DUSK Moreau gingerly lifts the vinyl sheet , and Prendick peers down with distaste bordering on revulsion at the mutilated body strapped to the operating table . The automatic is still clutched in his hand . Moreau watches him cooly . MOREAU You tell me , is that human ? PRENDICK I do n't know what she is . MOREAU Actually , she 's a genetic hybrid . We call them Chimaeras . Prendick looks uncomprehendingly at him . PRENDICK Very poetic . What does it mean ? MOREAU Animals , engineered in the image of humans . PRENDICK I 've always heard you people are desperate for grant money . But animals into humans , do n't you think that 's a reach ? Moreau draws the sheet over the woman 's remains again and turns away from the operating table ; Prendick follows . MOREAU If I 'm to to succeed at improving mandkind , then what I create must have human form . PRENDICK You 'll only succeed in filling tabloid headlines . There 's no market for home made people . Creating these things is immoral . MOREAU War and death generated by the twisted laws of nations ... is that the moral highground ? Prendick has no response . Moreau rubs his eyes wearily . MOREAU I ca n't believe I 'm having to explain myself like this . Montgomery told me what you did , I hoped you believed that humanity can be improved ? PRENDICK I do n't see this as improving it . MOREAU Why not ? I 've improved other living things ... created wheat that grows in the Sahara , other plants that kill and eat their own predators . Everything has to start with basics , like creating a new race without the evil or venality of our species . PRENDICK This half dissected thing was sacrificed to that goal ? MOREAU Growth must be accelerated , centuries of evolution compressed into minutes , the process takes its toll on the organism . PRENDICK And the screams ? MOREAU Deliberate pain serves only as a training tool . It will fall away from us one day , along with it 's depraved twin , pleasure . Prendick gives him a sharp look . MOREAU Why do you doubt me , Mr. Prendick , because you failed improve humanity with laws ? PRENDICK I only set out to solve a few local problems . I leave improvements on the human race to a higher authority . MOREAU I choose to believe that authority works through me ... pushes me to finish my work . Moreau stops by the pen that holds the black leopard from the boat . The animal is comatose now , its belly already hideously distended , kept alive only by nutrients fed directly into its veins by a row of drips . MOREAU I chose this creature for its strength to withstand the rigors of accelerated fetal growth . PRENDICK It 's not doing well . Maybe you chose wrong . MOREAU She 's being devoured by a fetus growing at over fifty times the normal rate . Her life will end to give new life . That seems cruel to you does n't it ? PRENDICK Yes , it does . MOREAU And to me . But I have no choice . My own clock runs at accelerated speed . I must finish before I 'm finished . ( passionately ) And I 'm close ... I 'm very close ... She 's going to me my breakthrough . I know it ... CUT TO : INT . LABORATORY - DUSK . Moreau dons a curious pair of goggles . He hands a pair to Prendick . MOREAU Do you know the term nanotechnology ? PRENDICK I know enough Greek to know nano means small . MOREAU Very small ... It involves mechanically shifting things on a molecular level . Moreau demonstrates the laboratory 's centerpiece , a combined laser and electron microscope , its needle thin blue beam focused minutely on a tiny slide , its glow bathing the room in an eerie bluegreen luminescence . MOREAU Nanotechnology enables us to isolate and transfer specific gene sequences . Then through artificial insemination and surrogacy we can create hybrids that would be impossible in conventional crossbreeding . The beam of the laser moves down into a subatomic world that is suddenly ablaze with light . Rising before them are the spiralling helices of the DNA molecule , the fundamental building block of life spinning in the laser 's glare . MOREAU My work will form the basis of a renaissance in genetic engineering that will transform the new century . CUT TO : INT . THE LAB - A MONITOR - NIGHT We are watching the early days of the experiment . Moreau , younger now , oversees the work of a chain-smoking behaviorist . MOREAU I won ’ t bore you with our early efforts . Basically we moved through herbivores to carnivores to capitalize on the intelligence that goes with predation . Then , taking a gorilla , I made my first `` Man '' . The videotape CUTS to a shaky handheld SHOT of a squat , darkskinned APE MAN walking on the front lawn , holding hands with Moreau . MOREAU Everything our race has forgotten is being found again , here on this island as if for the very first time . That 's Prima , our first real success ... We took him from the surrogate mother at birth and raised him here in the compound . Dr. Conway was with me then . Prendick watches now as an attractive chain-smoking woman , DR. CONWAY , submits Prima to a battery of intelligence tests , flashcards , and reading-readiness tests . MOREAU By the age of five , Prima could speak English at least as well as the average human child of the same age . Conway was incredibly gifted in communicating with him . Dr. Conway holds up a drawing of a suburban street . All appears normal in the picture save for the presence of a car with square wheels and an elegant-looking woman who is strolling down the sidewalk with a tiger on a leash . DR. CONWAY ( ON TAPE ) Now , Prima , can you see anything wrong with this picture ? Prima scratches his head . DR. CONWAY ( ON TAPE ) Come on , Prima . Big thinks , baby . Big thinks . Prima extends his hand to touch the square wheel but ignores the tiger . PRIMA ( ON TAPE ) Car ? DR. CONWAY ( ON TAPE ) Ver-ry good ! She makes a mark in her notebook , the shadow of a frown crossing her face . MOREAU It 's impossible , really , to gauge non-human intelligence by human standards . Moreau 's eyes shine with intense feeling as he watches Conway on the screen . MOREAU Conway worked tirelessly with them . She was so dedicated ... inspired . Dr. Conway produces another drawing , a depiction of several objects , a house , a chair , a tree , a flower and a hat . DR. CONWAY ( ON TAPE ) Now , Prima , which one do you go to when there's a storm ? When it 's wet and raining ? PRIMA ( ON TAPE ) Tree . He touches the drawing and Dr. Conway shakes her head . DR. CONWAY ( ON TAPE ) No , Prima . You go to the house when it rains . Prima frowns and bows his head , his shoulders hunched . PRIMA ( ON TAPE ) Damn me good . Prima takes one of Dr. Conway ’ s cigarettes and lights it smoking nervously as though afraid it might be taken from him . MOREAU Today the population of our island stands at more than sixty . That 's not counting the creatures without human speech or form . Altogether I 've made more than a hundred and twenty , some had to be destroyed . Prendick reacts to this word . PRENDICK What happened to Dr. Conway ? MOREAU Dr. Conway died . The video images give way to scenes of carnage , the laboratory floor awash with blood . MOREAU ( with difficulty ) An experiment that got out of control . A thing with a human face that moved like a snake . Incredibly strong , enraged by the pain of its creation ... It killed her here , then escaped . We cornered it and destroyed it in the northern part of the island . In the chaos other creatures escaped as well . Regrettably , there was some hybridization beyond my control . Moreau reaches for the remote control and stops the tape . MOREAU Her death was a personal tragedy for me . I must see that it was n't for nothing . PRENDICK The people who fund you know nothing of this . MOREAU The Foundation for the Humanities ? ... Surely you know of them ? PRENDICK ( bothered ) They 've sponsored UN work involving human rights ... MOREAU Including your own ? Prendick says nothing , but it 's probably true . PRENDICK Are n't you ever afraid ? MOREAU Of what ? PRENDICK That you ’ re going too far ... That you ’ ve already gone too far . This slightly changes the temperature . Moreau seems from here on to be drifting away from Prendick . MOREAU I was researching . It led this way and I followed it . That 's what good science is , Mr. Prendick . It takes a man way beyond fear . A feral CHITTERING comes from behind him now and Moreau glances around . On a bookshelf , an arm 's reach away , two tiny , hunchbacked mice men , their bodies covered in a fine , brown fur , are squaring off over a mate . One of the mice men picks up a pin and shakes it at his companion , emitting a threatening SQUEAK . MOREAU On occasion I succeed . I bring them very close to real humanity . But unless instinct is controlled chemically or with pain , the animal returns . But I will eventually prevail . Violence will be channelled into courage and duty . Sexuality transmuted into religious ecstasy . The potential for refinement is limitless . He seems to no longer be speaking to Prendick , or to anybody else . The black leopard WHIMPERS softly from somewhere deep in its trance . Moreau faces Prendick . He seems weary . MOREAU You 've heard it all , Mr. Prendick . I have no more secrets . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - DUSK We see a time lapse view of the enclosure as dusk shelves off into night ; the Plant People creeping across the lawn , trying to flee the lengthening shadows . Their SINGING gradually dies away and they draw their branches tight around themselves as the night deepens and the lights come on behind them in the big house . The sound of a CNN broadcast can be heard intoning World News . CNN ( O.S . ) Reports have put casualties as high as six hundred thousand in what is now the third day of continuous conflict ... CUT TO : INT . PRENDICK 'S ROOM - DUSK Prendick is on his bed watching a small portable TV on the bedside table . Aissa steps silently into the room . Apparently uninterested in the TV , she watches Prendick . CNN ( O.S . ) Emergency sessions of the UN Security Council have brought no promise of a truce , but an increasing threat that neighboring nations may join the conflict . For an on scene assessment we go to Molly Zuckerman , in Kabul ... Prendick settles back on the bed and Aissa 's hand reaches and turns the TV off . He lies in the near darkness over preferring the sighing song of the plants and wild animal noises to the voice from the world beyond . As his gaze drifts to the open door of his room , the sight of something brings a trace of smile to his face . Aissa stands at the doorway , watching him in large-eyed silence . Prendick extends his hand . Aissa pads quietly into the room and takes his , gazing down at him on the bed . AISSA Are you sad , Prendick ? PRENDICK Sad ? AISSA Sad about what has happened in the world you came from . PRENDICK It seems a long way off . AISSA It does n't matter what happens out there . Aissa smiles and gently rubs the back of his hand against her cheek . AISSA Is there some one you miss ? PRENDICK No one special , Aissa . AISSA And you no longer wish to runaway ... to New York ? Prendick looks into her eyes . PRENDICK Sit here . Aissa settles on the bed , still holding Prendick 's hand . AISSA Even if you do n't run away , you will go someday and leave me . PRENDICK ( smiles ) Hey , did n't I make you a promise , about New York . AISSA That was only to get me to help you . That was a lie . Seeing her , feeling her caress , Prendick is very aroused . His gently cups her chin then gently draws her lips to a tender kiss . Their lips part and Prendick whispers softly . PRENDICK That was then . This is not a lie . His lips again touch hers . Their mouths open and with the slightest touches of lips and tongue tips they taste each others taste . Prendick sighs as he traces the strange sensual contours of her mouth . His hands barely brush the top of her sarong and it drops away revealing small , firm , perfect breasts . Aissa arches her back with a sudden rush of feeling as Prendick 's palms gently brush her erect nipples . In sudden arousal , Aissa ’ s hands search down Prendick 's body inside his shirt ; agile fingers glide down his chest to find the hairy centerline of his muscular abdomen . He guides her hand further forcing an awareness of his desire . Aissa gasps , perhaps with fear of the unknown or perhaps with instinctual longing . While she kisses him , Prendick 's hands settle on her buttocks and he positions her over him . Then , slowly and gently he settles her loins to his own . Aissa whimpers at sensations that are both new and part of her basic desire . Both she and Prendick are caught up and equal in their pleasure . Their movements reflect intense hunger for more of what they both are feeling . Thought is abolished by the frantic pulses of instinct . Prendick 's kisses Aissa 's shoulders and neck , tasting the flavor and texture of her skin , the soft curves of her musculature . Then his lips find the hard bud of her nipple and the pleasure is beyond control . Aissa feels a current course her body . She stretches forward , lying atop Prendick with her arms extended above his head . As she releases a feral cry which excites Prendick 's own release , her hands clutch the bedding , her nails extend from her fingers and she draws them down in catlike expression of her orgasm . They have become claws that tear long deep rents in the sheets . A figure , watching from the shadows of the hallway , turns and moves away as the lovers settle , exhausted , into each others arms . CUT TO : INT . THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Moreau sits at the piano playing out the gentle layers of Gnossienne No-l , by Satie . His expression is distant , wistful , lost somewhere in his own past . CUT TO : INT . THE BEDROOM - NIGHT The door to the bathroom is open . Prendick watches as Aissa steps from the shower and begins toweling herself dry . As he watches her she licks her palms and runs her hands quickly through her hair in a distinctly cat-like gesture of grooming . Prendick 's gaze lowers to the bed , to the rents torn into the bedding by her nails . PRENDICK Aissa , who was your mother ? Aissa answers as she steps into the room . AISSA I do n't know ! PRENDICK You do n't know ? AISSA I do n't remember her ... He took me away from her when I was born . He said she was from Fiji . For an instant her pointed ears are revealed , she shakes her long hair down over her shoulders , covering them . She looks down at him , nervously . AISSA Why do you ask me this ? Prendick says nothing . AISSA I 'm as human as you are ! Prendick looks at her , unable to eliminate the question of her origins from his mind . AISSA ( deeply earnest , in tears ) Prendick . I love you . Is this the way an animal behaves ? Do animals cry ? PRENDICK I do n't know , Aissa . But I 'm not sure it matters . He reaches out to her and holds her . As she cuddles in his arms she speaks . AISSA He will never use me like he has used the others . If I am ever pregnant it will be by you . Off Prendick 's look . CUT TO : EXT . THE VERANDAH - NIGHT Like characters from a Conrad novel , Montgomery and Moreau are finishing drinks . M'Ling comes out with a tray . As he takes up their glasses , Moreau preps a cheroot . MOREAU Personally , I think that what goes on in that village like some grotesque cartoon of the human condition . MONTGOMERY Being a bit hard on them , do n't you think ? MOREAU I 'd rather he had n't seen it . M'Ling , having cleared the drinks , lights Moreau 's cigar then shambles into the house with his tray . MONTGOMERY I 'd rather he 'd drowned . There was no reason to turn the launch back . But you ordered it . Moreau smiles at him . MOREAU It never hurts to have a fresh view on what one does and thinks . I was intrigued when you told me what he did , I thought he could bring and interesting perspective to our work . Aissa moves quietly from a side door of the house . She pauses by the vegetation which surrounds the veranda and listens . MONTGOMERY He can bring us a shitload of trouble . I don't see him just going on his way and sending us the occasional postcard . AisSa strains to hear them . MOREAU I agree , his leaving the island could be problematic . MONTGOMERY His staying is a problem too . He 's knocking toes with Aissa . Moreau 's eyebrows go up in exaggerated surprise . MOREAU Oh , now I know why he suddenly bothers you . MONTGOMERY I 'd remind you , she 's your daughter . MOREAU Yes , there 's much of me in her . But mainly because of a shortage of genetic material . I'm fond of her , but that 's all , just fond . The day will come when she 'll be useful as a surrogate . Perhaps he could b e useful too ... a fresh source of uncorrupted DNA . Aissa winces as she hears this . MONTGOMERY So his is `` Uncorrupted DNA '' ... Not very subtle are we , Moreau ? MOREAU I 'm not being judgmental but I think all those drugs have left a mark on you . Montgomery stares ahead in obvious jealous rage . MOREAU Easy now , Monty . If I could have engineered her sexual preference , I 'd have put her in your arms . A gong sounds off screen . Moreau rises . MOREAU It 's dinner time . CUT TO : INT . THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT Moreau sits at the head of the long table which has been laid for dinner , holding a cigar . Prendick sits across from him , while Montgomery sits somewhere between them . MOREAU Our islanders have been given speech , the beginnings of a society , morality , laws ... PRENDICK That chanting is a legal system . MOREAU Admittedly it 's primitive but it 's a beginning . I invite you to improve on it . PRENDICK I 'll leave the drafting of your Bill of Rights to someone else . MONTGOMERY Eddie only wants to be involved here in a very selective way . Prendick senses Montgomery 's hostility . MOREAU I 'm sorry Mr. Prendick declines my offer . But I can create in the laboratory an innate a respect for law . Which is the first facet of a whole and healthy society . PRENDICK A whole and healthy society . This place doesn't really have that look . MONTGOMERY Do n't worry Eddie . Later we 'll really jazz them up ... color co-ordinate them and accesorize them , you wo n't be able to tell the little buggers from anybody else you 'd run into at the mall . ( He looks toward the door ) In fact there 's a look you do n't mind . Moreau and Prendick turn to see Aissa emerge awkwardly from the study door , followed by Azazello and M'Ling , who carries a steaming platter of curiously colored vegetables . MOREAU Ah , darling . Please come and join us . AISSA ( slightly cool ) Thank you , father . Aissa seats herself at the table , her eyes downcast . MOREAU Vegetables , Mr. Prendick ? Our own produce . We are all vegetarians here . As Moreau speaks , Azazello lays a silver serving dish on the table and lifts the lid to reveal an ill-cooked rabbit resting on a bed of herbs . Moreau 's eyebrows go up . He flashes a look at Montgomery . MOREAU Montgomery , could n't this have waited ? MONTGOMERY You said I could use my discretion . MOREAU Your indulgence was to be personal , not shared . MONTGOMERY I felt generous . I think sharing the rabbit is a very civilized gesture , do n't you Eddie ? PRENDICK No doubt about it . Actually you shared one you do n't know about . It was in the undergrowth at the back of the enclosure with its head torn off . MOREAU ( alarmed and angry ) Torn off ? Hear that , Montgomery . MONTGOMERY I swear . None of them saw me kill . Prendick picks up on the rift between them . PRENDICK Just before I found the rabbit , I saw a man drinking from the stream . MOREAU Sucking his drink ? PRENDICK Slurping it right up . Down on all fours . MOREAU After a kill they drink . It sweetens the salt taste of blood ... MONTGOMERY Well , there 's another carnivore out of the closet . So much for the Law and control of baser instincts , Moreau . MOREAU ( to Montgomery ) With you for a role model , I 'm not surprised . ( to Prendick ) This man you saw , would you know him again ? AISSA Lo-Mai ! It was Lo-Mai who drank from the stream . MOREAU Thank you , Sweetheart . I thought so ... Well , we 'll have to make an example of him . AISSA ( fiercely , rapidly , under her breath like a catechism ) Punishment is swift and sure ! Prendick stares at her . MOREAU I 've had my eye on Lo-Mai for awhile . He 's been sloping off with the Hyena- Swine and making all kinds of trouble . We 'll call a special assembly tomorrow . Mr. Prendick , identify him . I 'll ask you to formally . PRENDICK Forget it . Leave me out of this . MONTGOMERY You 're a witness , man . Consider yourself subpoenaed . MOREAU ( passionately ) I 'm afraid I ca n't leave you out of it . Just being here makes you one of us . Moreau stubs out his cigar and gets to his feet . MOREAU If they get a taste for blood , we 're finished . Moreau leaves the room , exchanging a covert conspiratorial look with M'Ling . Aissa follows . Montgomery glances at Prendick , who is picking uneasily at the rabbit . MONTGOMERY How 's the rabbit ? PRENDICK A little pink . But Prendick 's eyes are on Azazello who is standing in the study door , licking his hands , clearly excited by this new and dangerously addictive taste . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - NIGHT Prendick walks out onto the steps of the veranda . He stares out at the distant moonlit sea . Hearing something , he turns and Aissa approaches . He smiles , but her expression is dark . Seeing her eyes which have the faintest trace of glow , Prendick reacts . AISSA Why do you look at me like that ? PRENDICK Nothing ... I ... AISSA You must n't trust them ... They are bad men . PRENDICK Why do you say that ? AISSA They lie . I have heard them . PRENDICK What did they lie about ? Aissa steps close to him . AISSA They will not let you leave , ever . They will use you . They use everyone . PRENDICK Aissa , do you know how to use the radio ? AISSA M'ling knows ... CUT TO : INT . THE RADIO HUT - NIGHT M'Ling sits hunched over a two-way radio , wearing an ill-fitting set of headphones and barking into the transmitter . M'LING This is Biostation Echo Rio Delta calling on all channels . Come in ? Is anyone receiving me ? Prendick , seated beside him waits , but nothing comes . Aissa watches from the background . M'LING There 's nothing but static . Been that way for five days . Montgomery 's voice suddenly booms from the back of the shack . MONTGOMERY Unless we 're jamming our own radio to keep you from leaving . M'ling looks suddenly terrified . Aissa backs away and Montgomery steps up to the radio set . MONTGOMERY You 've got some real paranoia going , Eddie . Ever think maybe there 's nothing out there anymore ... Maybe we 've really gone and done it this time . Maybe we 're the only ones left . You and me and the Doc . PRENDICK And Aissa . MONTGOMERY Yeah , let 's include her . We 'll need a female entity to start it up again . ( He turns to Aissa ) Post-nuclear family values is what we 're after here . Aissa backs out the door and M'ling retreats to the shadows then out to the surrounding jungle . Montgomery faces Prendick . MONTGOMERY They 're always a bit fearful . In my opinion the veggies have corrupted the old man 's seed . PRENDICK They 're both his children . MONTGOMERY All his children . Since all I do is drag my big muddy boots in and out of the temple of my body , I guess he figures my DNA was n't all there . PRENDICK Who was Aissa 's mother ? MONTGOMERY ( smiles ) Given the oddities of this place it 's an amazing thing to speculate about , is n't it ? Montgomery proffers a joint . Prendick is so preoccupied that he takes a deep drag without realizing it . MONTGOMERY There you go , man . Is n't that better than taking all this shit on the natch ? Prendick turns towards the door , stepping out into the night He's deeply troubled . EXT . THE VERANDAH - NIGHT Aissa is waiting for Prendick in the shadows beside the door . As he approaches , she glances up at him , her eyes study glistening . AISSA What did he tell you ? PRENDICK Who ? AISSA Montgomery . What did he say about me ? PRENDICK Nothing . AISSA He told you I 'm one of them , did n't he ? Prendick looks hard at her . AISSA Some kind of animal . Aissa makes a movement that is terrifyingly cat-like , her hands flying towards Prendick 's face . He grabs her wrists . She calms instantly . PRENDICK Aissa , we 've got to get off of this island . AISSA We can steal the launch . PRENDICK It 's three or four days to New Guinea . We'll need diesel and food and water . AISSA I can get food . There 's diesel in the storeroom . Tomorrow night there will be big screen after the play . Everyone will be there . That would be the time . Aissa touches the remote on a CD and the romantic ballad heard earlier begins . AISSA Stay with me tonight , Prendick ... ( She takes his hand . ) My Five Man . We still have time . She moves closer . Prendick touches her face , and she draws him gently into her embrace . AISSA Dance with me . Nothing else matters now . And for a while they dance together in the narrow puddle of light at one end of the long verandah . The power of Aissa 's close physical presence seems to overwhelm Prendick 's concern ; He looks into her eyes with an intensity and tenderness that seems beyond his control . Slowly , he surrenders to it ; with one hand he gently strokes her hair , lifts her head back and kisses her softly , then deeply , while beyond in the tropical night , the howling of some great , unseen beast rises now to greet the moon . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - DAY Moreau 's flag , the emblem of the Tree of Life , billows against the blazing blue sky . The sound of a HORN ; followed by a mounting CLAMOR of bestial voices . Moreau stands on a wooden rostrum beneath the flagpole the horn raised to his lips , Prendick , Montgomery , and M'Ling flanking him . Waggdi , Azazello and the other Dog Men are posted around the base of the rostrum on crowd control duty . At the sound of the horn , the Beast Folk bow on their knees and elbows and begin flinging dust over their heads . Montgomery , clipboard in hand , checks them off one by one . MONTGOMERY Sixty-two , sixty-three ... We 're coming up short here . MOREAU There are four more . PRENDICK I do n't see Lo-Mai . MONTGOMERY No big surprise there , buddy . Moreau sounds the HORN again and the Beast Folk writhe and with renewed fervor . Then , slinking through the main gate , Lo-Mai and the HYENA-SWINE followed by Assassimon , dressed linen trousers . The other animals shoot vicious glances at Moreau passes the horn to M'Ling . grovel comes in white him . MOREAU Silence ! The Beast Folk sit back on their haunches now and rest from their worshipping . MOREAU Where is my Sayer of the Law ? The horned man bows his face to the dust . MOREAU Say the words . SAYER OF THE LAW Not to go on all fours ; that is the Law . The kneeling assembly recites the words after him swaying from side to side and striking up the dust with their hands . ALL ( CHORUS ) Not to go on all-fours ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? Not to slurp up drink , that is the Law . Are we not men ? Not to eat flesh nor fish ; that is the Law . Are we not men ? MOREAU STOP ! Silence falls at once . The Beast Folk know what 's coming and glance furtively at one another , a feeling of dread creeping over the assembly . MOREAU That Law has been broken . SAYER OF THE LAW None escape ! ALL ( CHORUS ) None escape ! MOREAU Who is he ? Moreau CRACKS his whip for effect as Lo-Mai and the Hyena-Swine glance at each other nervously . MOREAU WHO IS HE ? SAYER OF THE LAW Evil is he who breaks the Law ! Moreau meets Lo-Mai 's gaze , looking him steadfastly in the eye . MOREAU Whoever breaks the Law goes back to the House of Pain . ALL ( CHORUS ) Back to the House of Pain ! Back to the House of Pain , O Master ! AZAZELLO ( pathetically , eagerly ) Back to the House of Pain ! Back to the House of Pain ! Moreau turns his attention to Lo-Mai once more . MOREAU Do you hear ? The terrified Leopard Man springs to his feet now and leaps desperately towards the rostrum , his eyes aflame , a row of ivory fangs flashing out from beneath his curling lips . Waggdi raises his cattle prod to block the Leopard Man 's path , but Lo-Mai sweeps him aside , sending him sprawling to the dust , yelping and clutching at his bleeding snout . Azazello and the Hyena-Swine are watching with expressions of pure malice on their faces . They turn to one another conspiratorially . Lo-Mai mounts the rostrum , coming face to face now with Moreau who resolutely stands his ground . Moreau looks into the Leopard Man's eyes , and it is as if he is looking into his very soul . MOREAU My son ... Then with a snarl Lo-Mai lunges at Moreau , but Azazello strikes him down with his cattle prod . He cringes , trying to protect himself as the Dog Men surround him . Azazello pins his arms behind his back while Waggdi grabs him vengefully by the hair , pulling his head back so that Moreau can look him in the face once more . The Hyena-Swine has been joined by other Chimaera , who are watching with threatening expressions . Assassimon looks on with something close to pity . Lo-Mai 's eyes are wide and glazed with fear . LO-MAI ( imploringly ) Father ... Moreau pats Lo-Mai 's head soothingly . MOREAU It 's all right , my son . I forgive you for everything . With one fluid motion , Moreau draws his revolver and puts it to LoMai 's head , squeezing the trigger . There is a deafening concussion and the Leopard Man falls . Assassimon , the Hyena-Swine and other Chimeras recoil as if they 've been shot too . For a moment , all is quiet . MONTGOMERY ( almost to himself , with bitterness ) He 's with the program now ... he 's really a believer now , man ... Moreau gives him a hard look , then looks to the Sayer of the Law . SAYER OF THE LAW The gun has spoken ! It is good ! AZAZELLO Hallelujah ! Assassimon , the Hyena-Swine and the Chimaera standing with them are looking on with undisguised hatred now . Prendick looks in mounting horror from Azazello , who is already bending over Lo-Mai 's twitching body as if excited by the smell of his blood , to Moreau who stands over them , the smoking gun in his hand , his white suit specked with blood , his eyes filled with cold fire , the VOICES of the chanting congregation rising around him . ALL ( CHORUS ) His is the hand that wounds ! His is the hand that heals ! flash ! His is the lightning His is the House of Pain ! Prendick stares in horror . Assassimon , the Hyena-Swine and the others look meaningfully at each other . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - MID-AFTERNOON Prendick stands waist-high in a field of marijuana plants watching as the ball game gets under way on the front lawn , Assassimon coming up to bat . Beside him , Azazello and Montgomery , his long hair tied back by a greasy bandana , are busy watering the plants . There is a CRACK of wood against horsehide , followed by a spattering of APPLAUSE and Montgomery glances up in time to see the Monkey Man reaching first base . Montgomery plucks a joint from his bandana and fires it up . MONTGOMERY Assassimon 's in his element . Fantastic knuckleball . But then , look at his knuckles . Oh shit . Here comes trouble . Prendick follows Montgomery 's gaze , to see Kiril and the HyenaSwine wading towards them through the marijuana field . KIRIL Hail , to the Other with the whip . MONTGOMERY Hail to you , too . There 's a Third with a whip now , so you 'd better watch yourself . HYENA-SWINE Was he not made ? He said ... he said he was made . KIRIL The Third with the whip , he that walks weeping into the sea , has a long thin face . MONTGOMERY He has a long thin whip , and it hurts . KIRIL Yesterday he bled and wept . HYENA-SWINE You never bleed or weep . The Master does not bleed or weep . MONTGOMERY You 'll fucking bleed and weep if you do n't shut up ! He turns away , passing the joint to Azazello . The Dog Man smokes it greedily . PRENDICK You think that 's a good idea ? MONTGOMERY I do n't know . Maybe I 'm too liberal ... PRENDICK I do n't think you know what you 're doing . That was a crazy fucking thing , showing Azazello how to skin and gut a rabbit . MONTGOMERY Well , shit ... It 's not like he killed the damned thing . He gets to have a few perks , too . He works hard . Do n't you Azazello , old sock , old buddy ... you ’ re a goddamned good old son-of-abitch . He scratches Azazello behind the ear , calling him jocular names as the Dog Man fawns on him in extraordinary delight . AZAZELLO Yes , yes , most certainly so , Master . Azazello passes the joint to the Hyena-Swine . KIRIL The Law says you must not destroy life . MONTGOMERY Yeah , that 's right . You know it is . KIRIL None must not take another life but you ... By the water ... You . MONTGOMERY I what ? You fuzzy bastard ! Kiril makes the motion of breaking the rabbit 's neck and gives an incredibly accurate imitation of its scream . There is an awkward silence as Montgomery meets Kiril 's gaze , the Hyena-Swine watching them intently . Behind them the BISON MAN steps onto the pitcher 's mound . Going to the plate , Assassimon holds the bat unsteadily in his hands . MONTGOMERY Are you judging me ? Are you fucking daring to compare yourself to me ? KIRIL No , no ! Everyone does it sometime , I turn over a rock once in a while and lap up an insect or two . MONTGOMERY Insects do n't really count . Everybody kills them . PRENDICK Yeah . But we do n't all necessarily eat them . The Bison Man pitches the ball at Assassimon , striking him in the head with a resounding CRACK . BISON MAN Howzat ! There is a raucous clamoring of JEERS AND APPLAUSE as Waggdi and the Sloth Man pick up Assassimon 's twitching body and carry him off the field . BISON MAN How was that ? Prendick turns his eyes towards the middle distance where Assassimon lies in the arms of the FOX LADY , while the Sloth Man dabs ineffectually at his bleeding head . Out on the field , with the game interrupted , the Bison Man starts to run around and around the bases , a relentless force of nature scuffing up dust in the lazy afternoon air . He looks to the Hyena-Swine , who is watching him with a barely concealed menace . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - DUSK Prendick stares out across the compound towards the jetty and the launch that will take him to freedom ; beyond , the fiery rim of the setting sun . Then he sees the figure of Moreau in his white suite standing at the end of the jetty , his eyes turned towards the same horizon . A small posse of Beast Folk crouch at a respectful distance behind him , watching in bewilderment as if incapable of understanding what holds their master 's attention . Prendick is filled with sympathy , almost awe , as he watches Moreau 's lonely , terrifying courage . CUT TO : EXT . THE JETTY - DUSK Waggdi comes loping up to Moreau and bows before him . WAGGDI You must come at once , Master . The contractions have started . MOREAU Thank you , Waggdi . See that the entertainments begin on time . Waggdi turns and lopes away , happy on his errand . Moreau turns away from the setting sun and , for a moment , his mask slips , the weariness in his eyes showing through . Then his face hardens and he starts back towards the house . CUT TO : INT . THE GUEST ROOM - DUSK Aissa sits in front of the dressing table mirror . She closely examines her face . She appears distressed as her finger touches a small cluster of catlike whiskers that has begun to grow from her cheek . She frowns and picks up a heavy tweezer . In what is obviously painful she plucks them out , then daubs away a spot of blood with a tissue . There comes a knock at the door and she turns with a start . The door opens a crack to admit Waggdi 's snout . WAGGDI You 're on in five . AISSA Thank you , Waggdi . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - NIGHT A performance of `` Alice '' is under way before a small crowd . The Sayer of the Law in his Moreau mask is shaking his rattle at Azazello who crouches on his haunches before the small portable screen from the Nissan hut . Aissa faces Azazello whose face is painted in a Cheshire Cat 's huge grin . Prendick looks on from the back of the crowd . AISSA What sort of people live here ? AZAZELLO To the right lives a Hatter , to the left a March hare . You can visit either if you like . They're both quite mad . AISSA But I do n't want to go among mad people . AZAZELLO Ca n't be helped . We 're all mad here . I 'm mad . You 're mad . There are some nervous giggles from the audience . AISSA How do you know that I 'm mad ? AZAZELLO You must be or you would n't have come . Aissa looks to Prendick , catching his eye for a moment . He smiles at her . Azazello notices the interchange , and smiles obscenely within the exaggerated Cheshire smile . His next line carries a trace of menace . AZAZELLO This place demands madness . CUT TO : INT . THE LABORATORY - NIGHT The convulsing body of the black leopard is strapped to the operating table , ringed by Moreau , Montgomery , Waggdi , and another of the Dog Men , all of them clad now in surgical masks and gowns . Montgomery leans over the animal , then glances up at Moreau , sweat beading his forehead . MONTGOMERY We 've got to cut her , Doc . We 've got no choice . Moreau nods and looks to Waggdi . MOREAU Caesarean , Waggdi . Scalpel . Waggdi hands him the blade and , bending over the stricken animal , the doctor begins the operation . CUT TO : EXT . THE VERANDAH – NIGHT Prendick and Aissa standing at one end of the lon talking in hushed voices as Prendick checks their bundles . AISSA How was I ? PRENDICK Terrific . You were the best `` Alice '' I 've ever seen . AISSA And how many Alices have you seen ? He holds her by the shoulders . PRENDICK It 's time , let 's go . Aissa shoulders her bundle and follows him on tiptoe through the study door . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - NIGHT A screen is set up for a CD ROM projection system . Azazello punches a keyboard and shouts . AZAZELLO Yaba daba doo ! The `` animated '' Fred Flintsone appears on the screen and echoes the shout which is then excitedly repeated by the gathering . As Fred reacts to something off screen , Azazello pushes another key and -A colorized clip from the film `` Blonde Venus . ' A dancing gorilla on the stage of a thirties nightclub . The audience GASPS in awe as the gorilla delicately removes its head , revealing itself to be Marlene Dietrich . Then , before their widening eyes , she strips off the rest of her gorilla suit and launches into a song called `` Hot Voodoo . '' The beast people watch , transfixed . Giggling with barely contained excitement , Azazello punches wildly at a keyboard and— Godzilla appears . To gasps and applause he begins destroying Tokyo . CUT TO : INT . THE LABORATORY - NIGHT The black leopard is close to death now , a gaping wound in its abdomen pinned open by surgical clamps as Moreau reaches inside it to retrieve its premature offspring . WAGGDI The incubator is ready , Master . MOREAU Alright , I 'm going in . He turns his attention to the large throbbing still coiled within its mother 's dying shell . cutting into the membrane . He has performed a operations but even he is unprepared for what life form that is Moreau reaches down , hundred similar comes next . There is a terrible , wet tearing SOUND and something upwards from the incision , lunging towards Moreau . A explodes malformed , squealing thing , bifurcated , far bigger than it should be , its skinless snout opening wide to reveal a double row of jagged teeth . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - NIGHT Prendick and Aissa struggle with jerry cans of diesel to the flatbed truck . When they have humped the last of the cans , Prendick goes to the cab . Aissa stands watch beside the open door as Prendick puts his beneath the dashboard of the flatbed . There are sparks as he begins hot wiring the truck . There is a low GROWL and the flatbed RUMBLES into life causing Prendick to sit up too suddenly , banging his head on the dashboard . PRENDICK Let 's go ! Suddenly , both of them freeze , hearing the sounds of SCREAMS and BREAKING GLASS coming from the laboratory . Prendick turns towards the Nissan hut in time to see one of the Dog Men appear in its lighted doorway . The figure is drenched in blood , its eyes wide and terrified . It makes as if to step towards Prendick but then with a ROAR something red and half glimpsed brings him down . The Dog Man SCREAMS , hanging onto the doorframe for a moment . Then , with an awful RENDING SOUND he loses his grasp and is dragged SCREAMING back into the laboratory . An instant later his screams are cut short and low , bloodcurdling SNARL ripples across the courtyard . PRENDICK Get back ! Aissa retreats into the safety of the big house and Prendick is just starting back towards the flatbed when the hunched shape of something not unlike a huge , flayed cat appears in the laboratory doorway , walking on its hind legs and slowly pulling itself to its full height , its talons glistening with blood . It stretches itself and Prendick 's mind reels as he sees that the creature seems to be actually growing in bulk before his very eyes , its muscles rippling in the half light . He reaches for the door of the flatbed but the Chimaera sees him now and launches itself at him with the speed of an express train , its nostrils flaring . He catches a fleeting glimpse of an awful face , not human , not animal . Prendick flings up one arm to defend himself but the Chimaera flings him headlong , wafer thin talons laying open his chest and forearm . He rolls over and over , his hands clasped over his head . A volley of shots is heard . Then the beast is gone , bounding towards the main gate . Prendick tries to sit up and then collapses again . Moreau comes running up , a rifle in his hands , his white face dewed with blood . There is a loud CRASH of rending metal and the night is lit up for a moment by an explosion of sparks from the electrified fence . Moreau stops in his tracks and Montgomery joins him , breathless and clutching an automatic in one hand . MOREAU It 's gone through the perimeter ... Waggdi ! Sound the alarm ! Moreau and Waggdi both make a dash for the big house while Montgomery kneels beside Prendick , examining the lacerations in his chest and arm . MONTGOMERY Jesus Christ , Eddie , that thing is loose ... It's unbelievably strong ... PRENDICK ( groaning ) Yeah , tell me about it ... MONTGOMERY Let me see that ... Oh Jesus ... you got ta get some disinfectant on these ... Aissa ! Aissa , who is cowering in the doorway of the big house , snaps to attention . MONTGOMERY Get the first aid kit ! Fast ! Aissa ducks back into the house and Prendick grimaces , closing his eyes . PRENDICK Ah fuck ... I feel like I 'm on fire ... MONTGOMERY Just hold on , buddy . Prendick grinds his teeth together as Aissa runs to him , carrying the First-Aid kit . Montgomery swabs his wounds with antiseptic . AISSA Hold still . Aissa presses her hands against Prendick 's forehead . There is a CLATTER OF HOOVES and Moreau goes riding past on his white horse , hunting rifle slung over one shoulder , a pack of BARKING Dog Men brandishing cattle prods following at his heels . He sees Montgomery attending to Prendick . MOREAU Never mind him ! Leave him ! Montgomery starts up , abandoning Prendick for a moment . MONTGOMERY Wait ! I 'll come ! It 's too dangerous ! Moreau glances back at him and there is something in his face , white as a death 's head in the moonlight , that causes Montgomery to fall silent . Moreau turns away , the Dog Men spurring his horse towards the main gate , running at his heels , in dismay . Montgomery staring after him CUT TO : INT . THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT Montgomery and Aissa lower Prendick onto the bed . He is naked now , sweat standing out on his forehead , his chest and arm swathed in bandages . He tries to open his eyes , wincing as if blinded by the yellow flare of the paraffin lamp . PRENDICK God ... why is that light so bright ? Seeing the hypodermic Prendick starts to react as Montgomery slides a needle into his forearm . MONTGOMERY Easy Eddie , you 're in shock ... There ... Prendick relaxes as Montgomery gets up and starts hastily towards the door . Aissa touches his face , soothing him as the drugs draw a chemical curtain across his pain . He sighs , looking up at her , haloed by the hallucinatory glare of the lantern . She smiles , taking his hand and placing it against her bosom . AISSA Sleep , Prendick . My poor Five-Man . I will make you well . Sleep ... Aissa lies beside him , forming herself cat-like against him . He slowly draws an arm over her . CUT TO : EXT . THE ISLAND - DAWN A seething , volcanic sun rises above the rim of the earth SOUND OF A HORN and the BAYING OF HOUNDS rising to greet it the from below the canopy of the rainforest . CUT TO : EXT . THE RAINFOREST - MORNING A flock of parrots scatter in dismay as a line of Beast People come CRASHING through a cane break , beating the foliage to drive out their quarry . Moreau follows at a distance on horseback , Waggdi walking fast beside him . Up ahead the undergrowth quivers and Waggdi freezes , sniffing the air . WAGGDI He ’ s close , Master . I smell him . Just a breath away . Moreau reigns his steed to a halt , cocking the hunting rifle . Waggdi steps forward towards the wall of greenery , his cattle prod raised defensively . He reaches out to touch the crushed leaves and when he draws back his fingers they are sticky with drying blood . He turns to Moreau , nodding his head as if to signal him , but at that instant the wall of the rainforest erupts behind him . With an ear-splitting SHRIEK the Chimaera plunges from its hiding place , wrenching Waggdi from his feet . The horse rears in panic , and Moreau is flung backwards from his saddle . He strikes a tree trunk , landing awkwardly , the breath driven from him , the hunting rifle still clenched in his hands . His horse bolts past him . Waggdi screams , his cattle prod , trying to fend off the Chimaera's jaws with but the creature drags him down , tightening its coils remorselessly around him . Moreau regains his feet , levelling the rifle as the Chimaera begins to ingest the struggling Dog Man . He catches a last glimpse of Waggdi 's bulging eyes , curiously calm now as if hypnotized by the immensity of what is happening to him . His body spasms and , with a HISS , the Chimaera casts him aside , turning its attention now towards Moreau . Moreau meets its gaze and the creature hesitates , fear sparking in its eyes . Then it raises its bifurcated snout and HOWLS . Moreau shivers , his expression faltering as the full pain and horror of what he has created comes home to him . MOREAU ( under his breath ) God ... Forgive me ... There is a terrible pity in his eyes now . The rifle wavers in his hands . Then with a feral snarl the Chimaera launches itself at him . He pulls the trigger and the rifle jumps in his hands , punching a hole the size of a fist in the beast 's torso . The creature is upon him before he can get off another round , driving the rifle from his hands , its jaws closing on his body from side to side as it savages him . Moreau goes limp and the creature drops him , gathering itself to full height , bellowing in mindless rage . Moreau 's eyes flicker open , hazy with shock . His good hand goes to his holster , drawing his pistol , his eyes calm as he looks the Chimaera in the face , seeing the beast 's glistening jaws widen before him . MOREAU Thy will be done . The beast pounces and he raises his gun . Plunging it into the gaping maw , he fires . The Chimaera shrieks , rearing backwards , its maimed head lashing from side to side . Then , its rage spent , it relinquishes its brief tenure on life , crumpling to the forest floor with a final hiss , pinning Moreau beneath the quivering carcass . The doctor groans , dragging himself from beneath the fallen creature and trying to stand but his legs give out and he falls to his knees . Looking up he sees a row of impossibly gaudy parrots regarding him from a branch above . He sighs as if overwhelmed by the terrible fertility of the island . Gazing around he sees that a silent ring of Beast Folk have emerged from the shadows and stand watching him . In their dull animal gaze is silent brooding contempt . Cudgels and machetes are clutched in their misshapen hands . Moreau recognizes Azazello , the Boar Man and the Hyena-Swine amongst the ranks and reaches out to them with a blood streaked hand , motioning them to come nearer . MOREAU Help me ... HYENA-SWINE The master bleeds . AZAZELLO If he bleeds he can die . HYENA-SWINE He can die ? MOREAU Help me ... for the love of God . HYENA-SWINE Do you love me father ? Do you love your son ? The Hyena-Swine pads across the clearing towards Moreau , its hackles rising , its tiny , pig like eyes sparkling with bloodlust . A machete glints in its hand . MOREAU I love you . HYENA-SWINE Then let your son embrace you . Moreau bows his head . MOREAU Children of the law ... forgive me ... HYENA-SWINE Law no more ! The machete swings in a gleaming arc and the good doctor 's body falls to the waiting earth . The Hyena-Swine raises the machete , seeing the master 's blood glistening in the tropical sunshine . HYENA-SWINE Now I am God . He licks Moreau 's blood from the blade and begins giggling hysterically while his comrades abandoning their fear close in and beat the doctor 's fallen body . Taking up the Hyena-Swine 's chant they release years of rage in animal savagery . ALL Law no more ! Law no more ! The parrots shift nervously on their perches taking flight one by one as the beast folk dance in bizarre celebration around Moreau's body . The birds rise up through the leafy canopy of the trees to the sky and the heavens beyond . Afterwards , something like snowflakes falls and melts in the Pacific sun and the distant thunder of an approaching storm rumbles over the scene . CUT TO : INT . THE GUEST ROOM – DAY THUNDER crashes outside and warm rain squalls against the glass . Aissa turns over , kissing Prendick on the forehead . He opens his eyes and she smiles at him . He looks at her , and his eyes widen . Some strange reversion has begun ; The imperfect upper-lip has become exaggerated , and a distinct fur-like down appeared has on her face , but she is nonetheless still beautiful . Prendick stares . She draws him close and he kisses her again . His face is guided by her hands down to her breasts . His lips find her nipples and she twists with arousal , then she guides his face further down her body to another set of breasts , vestigial buds that have erupted on the smooth skin of her torso . Prendick reacts , balancing on a knife edge of revulsion and desire , then he gives in to the latter , kissing wildly at her feral mammaries , aroused beyond any point of return . Again , louder , there comes the sound of THUNDER . CUT TO : EXT . THE RAINFOREST - DAY The THUNDER becomes the sound of hooves and we see the riderless white stallion racing through the trees , its flanks wet with foam . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND - DAY A violent storm lashes the island . A WAILING procession of Beast Folk , led by the Sayer of the Law , trudge slowly through the driving rain , their heads bowed as they bear Moreau back to the big house , his body held aloft , his arms outstretched as if crucified , his head tilted back , rain falling in his sightless eyes and washing the blood from his face in pink rivulets . Montgomery stands waiting for them on the front lawn , his features twisted in despair . Behind him Prendick comes slowly down the driveway , supported by Aissa . He is barefoot , dressed only in a blanket and a damp pair of flannel trousers . MONTGOMERY It 's all over . Oh god ... The procession comes to a halt and the Sayer of the Law steps forward to address Montgomery . SAYER OF THE LAW He is dead . AZAZELLO Is there a Law now ? Is it still to be this and that ? SAYER OF THE LAW Is there a Law , thou Other with the whip ? Is there a Law now that He is dead ? Montgomery looks to Prendick , his jaw hanging slackly . Prendick steps forward , Aissa clinging to his arm , and tries to take command of the situation . PRENDICK Of course there 's a Law . HYENA-SWINE Law no more ! PRENDICK There 's a law ! Listen to me ! He is n't dead ! The Beast People turn their sharp eyes upon him . PRENDICK He 's here ! Now ! He is n't dead . He 's left his body , but he 's here . You ca n't see him , but Right there ! Prendick points towards the leaden sky . Montgomery looks at him with amazed admiration . MONTGOMERY Good , buddy . That 's good . Jesus , that 's qreat ! PRENDICK You ca n't see him , but he can see you ! He's watching you right now ! KIRIL Fear the Law ! There is a flicker of lightning and the Beast People look nervously to the sky . Assassimon stares in terrible suspicion and uncertainty . KIRIL He is great , He is good ! PRENDICK Come with me ! We must bring his old body up to the big house . Then he 'll tell us what to do . He motions for them to follow , setting off at the head of the procession . Reluctantly , Assassimon joins them . CUT TO : EXT . THE COURTYARD - DUSK The rain has stopped now but the sky is still dark and threatening . The remaining Dog Men , under the command of M'Ling are busy making a pyre of brushwood and broken furniture . Moreau 's body , dressed in a pristine white suit and garlanded with flowers , is laid out on a pallet at the top of the pyre . Aissa kneels beside him now and places his Panama hat on his chest . Prendick watches her closely , almost desperately , for a sign of human grief . Tears start down Aissa 's cheeks . Prendick looks on , moved . CUT TO : INT . MONTGOMERY 'S QUARTERS - DUSK Montgomery sits hunched over the paraffin lantern , swigging from a bottle of vodka and downing pills by the handful , his gun on the tabletop beside him . Prendick sits opposite him , his eyes wandering over the disarray that surrounds them , the tattered posters and pathetic remnants of the counter-culture and Montgomery 's past life . From outside rises the SOUND OF DRUMS and bestial VOICES howling and keening in lamentation . PRENDICK We 're going to have to go out there -- and light that thing soon . I mean , if he starts getting ripe and they smell it , it 's all over . MONTGOMERY They 're all waiting ... the whole damn island ... Without the endorphins he put in their food they 'll revert quickly . They 'll need a firm hand with a whip in it . But I 've really got ta hand it to you , Eddie , you 're a survivor . This resurrection bit is fucking brilliant ... perfect thing for a primitive intelligence . They 'll eat it right up . PRENDICK Or they 'll eat us right up . MONTGOMERY Yeah , whatever ... Jesus , what a fucking life this is ... Spend twenty years living in squalid little rooms , living on cheap thrills , man , I have to say , life is a big mistake . Big mistake . And to end up in this , this shit ! This fucking island , ten years ! What for ? ? Eddie , we're nothing . We 're just nothing . We 're bubbles blown by a baby . PRENDICK We 're getting off of this island . MONTGOMERY Oh yeah ? And going where ? Look at me , man ... Where the fuck am I going to go ? PRENDICK Anywhere you like . MONTGOMERY ( He laughs . ) That 's a tough one , Eddie . I get off this island about once every two years , and I ca n't make it out there . People disgust me , man . I ca n't stand to be anywhere near them . Even the women . I rent them , then I ca n't bear to touch them . And I'll tell you something man ... You and your girlfriend are gon na find it mighty hard '' fitting in '' . I mean , just for openers , who's gon na rent to you ? It is n't like you come from different religious backgrounds , if you know what I mean ... Here , have a toke for fuck sake . PRENDICK Can we help her ? Is there anything we can do to ... MONTGOMERY To what , man ? Keep her sweet ? I know Moreau gave her special treatments . It 's in his notes ... PRENDICK What about the rest ? MONTGOMERY They 'll change , their D.N.A . will just start to unravel ... Come on , man , have a toke ... help yourself to my stash . I 've got everything you could possibly want right here . Speed , methadone , morphine , mescaline , reds , blues , 'ludes acid , lysergic and my own special brew ... The Montgomery Cocktail ! you want to go ? Come on , which way Try the Cocktail , you 'll go all over the fucking place ... PRENDICK I just want to go home . MONTGOMERY Well , fuck you then ! You wo n't party with me , I 'll party with them . I 'll show you what a real party animal is ! I 'm handing in my resignation from the whole fucking human race , effective immediately . Montgomery gets to his feet , clutching at the bottle , filling his pockets with pills . PRENDICK You 're not going to hand those out ! MONTGOMERY What ? Are you gon na stop me ? Jesus Christ , man , you 're not a lawyer , you 're a fucking missionary ... save her , him , why do n't you just open up a local branch of the S.P.C.A. ? PRENDICK You really are crazy . MONTGOMERY Did I ever say I was n't ? Prendick rises , facing him , and Montgomery snatches up the automatic , waving it at his head . MONTGOMERY Hey , man , you 're standing between me and the party lights . Get out of my way . PRENDICK Sure . Go ahead . Go ahead . Montgomery flings the door open , his eyes blots of deep black in the yellow light , the gun trembling in his hand . MONTGOMERY You know , man , you 've got no view . With you it's all survival . We 're right on the edge here , and I ai n't gon na miss it may be dead tomorrow , but I 'm gon na live it up tonight . He turns and goes out into the moonlight . M'Ling , who is waiting outside , rises to meet him . MONTGOMERY M'Ling ! M'Ling , my man ! Bring the flatbed around at once . It 's party time ! Prendick follows him to the doorway , looking out into the night . CUT TO : EXT . THE BEACH – NIGHT The crowd parts as Montgomery walks amongst them , dispensing pills . MONTGOMERY Free drugs ! Come on ! Who wants to get high ? Let 's see some hands . A forest of misshapen appendages rises around him and he fills each hand indiscriminately with whatever he pulls from his pockets . MONTGOMERY There you go ... a little Uptown for you , some Downtown for you ... Cat food for the dogs and dog food for the cats ... What 's science without a few drugs , huh , Eddie ? He addresses the assembly of Chimaera . MONTGOMERY It 's the dawning of a whole new deal , boys and girls . I 'm the Man now and we 're gon na have fun around here for a change . We 'll be laughing tonight ... The Beast People press tight around him , pawing at him helping themselves now to the contents of his pockets . CUT TO : EXT . THE COURTYARD – NIGHT Prendick , Aissa , and the remaining Beast People , still loyal to Moreau , stand ringed around the pyre . For a moment they're motionless , their heads bowed in a prayer , then Prendick tosses a lighted torch into the brushwood at the base of the mound and the flames begin to climb hungrily around Moreau 's body . The congregation remains silent , watching until More au 's body is lost in flame and smoke . Prendick turns to Aissa now , seeing her eyes glinting like an animal 's in the firelight . AISSA Will we go now ? PRENDICK Yes . They look at each other , a terrible awareness in Aissa 's face . AISSA I know , Prendick . I know what is happening to me ... I can feel it . PRENDICK It does n't matter . AISSA Yes , it matters . PRENDICK There 's a way to fix it , in your father 's notes . I 'll find it . We 'll bring you back . Now , go to the house . Get whatever you need to take . AISSA ( apprehensive ) Where are you going ? PRENDICK There 's something I have to do . He turns to address the assembly . PRENDICK Children of the Law ! Listen to me ! The Master has left a task for you ! He turns towards the laboratory , motioning for the Beast People to follow him . CUT TO : INT . THE LABORATORY - NIGHT Prendick strides down the aisleway between the cages , Kiril and the Sayer of the Law leading the remnants of the Beast People behind him . PRENDICK Empty the cages ! Free all of them ! The Beast Folk go to work at once , scooping rabbits from their hutches , dogs and cats and monkeys from their cages . Prendick stalks slowly through the devastated laboratory , flipping the switch on a Nagra as he passes , hearing Moreau 's VOICE , nothing more now than a magnetic ghost . MOREAU 'S VOICE Systolic pressure 3.2 . Diastolic pressure up to 4 . Pulmonary pressure stands at 5.8 . Prendick stops at the shelf , lifting Moreau 's black book . It falls open in his hands and he casts an eye over the chemical equations contained there , an escaped monkey scampering up to him to perch on his shoulder , mimicking his puzzlement at Moreau's notes . Behind him , the Sayer of the Law opens the incubators one by one , handing out the mewling mutant infants to a line of island women who bear them out into the safety of the orange night . CUT TO : EXT . THE BEACH - NIGHT The awesome SOUND of the Jimi Hendrix Experience throbbing from a tinny set of speakers , supplemented by a line of DRUMMING Beast Folk , tangling with the SOUNDTRACK of `` King Kong '' that is climbing on a screen set before the CD-ROM projector that has been set up for a rapt , tripped-out animal audience . A great bonfire is raining sparks into the sky farther up the beach , ringed by furiously dancing creatures . Beside the bonfire , an axe-wielding Dog Man is chopping up the remains of the beached motor launch and feeding them into the flames . Montgomery stands near the fire , burning of the boat , supervising the ritual a garland of flowers around his neck and a joint dangling from his lower lip . The Sloth Creature drags at the hem of his coat and he smiles sadly , turning out his pockets . MONTGOMERY All gone . See . All tapped out . We 're in the same boat now , ( points to the burning launch ) and there it is right there ! Up the creek without a paddle . Any of you ever hear that expression ? He starts to get undressed , throwing his clothes to the Beast People who grab at them eagerly , fighting for possession of the more treasured articles . Montgomery lifts his head up and shouts . MONTGOMERY How do you like this , Moreau ? Is n't this some wild shit ! The Beast People press tighter around him , reaching out to touch his pale skin . He giggles , looking up at the stars . MONTGOMERY All flesh is grass , boys and girls . You blink and it 's all gone ... He grabs an already disheveled Beast Woman and breaks into a demented , frenzied and very dirty boogie . The flatbed goes rumbling past , headlights blazing , circling dangerously close to the fire , joyriding through the night , going nowhere , M'Ling at the wheel . CUT TO : INT . THE STUDY – NIGHT Azazello unbolts the gun locker and opens it up to display its contents to his fellow conspirators : the Hyena-Swine , a bristly black Boar Man and a pair of the surviving Dog Men who still wear waiter 's coats . Behind them , the rest of the room is already in chaos as several of the Beast People root through Moreau 's papers , flinging the books from the shelves , the unleashed parrot flapping wildly around their heads . The Hyena-Swine hefts a Kalashnikov , his eyes glowing in anticipation . HYENA-SWINE Now we have the fire that kills . Now we are Gods ! Azazello weighs a hand grenade in his palm , his face cracking in a terrible , gap-toothed grin . CUT TO : INT . THE HALL – NIGHT Aissa crosses the hallway on her way to her room . There is a sudden rattle of automatic GUNFIRE followed by a sudden peal of raucous LAUGHTER from the direction of the study and she stiffens , drawing back against the wall with a HISS . Azazello appears now in the study door , clutching a bottle of brandy , the other two Dog Men following him at a pace . AZAZELLO Trip-trap , trip-trap ... and where are you going in the woods today , little girl ? Aissa edges towards the door but the Dog Men cut her off . AZAZELLO Looking for your five-finger man ? He ca n't help you . There are no masters anymore . He advances and she raises a hand as if to strike him . Her claws extend from her fingertips and her eyes glint in the firelight . The hair on her back raises as she emits a long catlike hiss . AZAZELLO Nicely now little kitten-Aissa or I 'll hurt you . Remember how the master hurt me ? Oh , how he whipped me . He gives an oily CHUCKLE , his voice becoming a growl . AZAZELLO But he spared your soft skin . One of the Dog Men reaches out to grab her hair and she bares her teeth in a feral snarl . Lashing out at Azazello , her claws rake his face nearly blinding him . Azazello stumbles back with a canine yelp , pawing at his snout . The other two Dog Men lunge at her , the blood lust rising in their eyes . Aissa turns . Finding no way out of the room she leaps toward the curtains . Locking her claws in the heavy material , she scrambles up toward the valence while the Dog Men try to grab her and pull her back . She tries to reach the large chandelier , but the curtains and valence give way and she falls back toward the floor ; in mid- fall she twists catlike to land on all fours in a crouch . A low threatening growl boils from her throat as she faces Azazello and the Dog Men , holding them at bay like a cornered cat as they maneuver cautiously to surround her . Suddenly , with a shriek she springs at Azazello . Her claws tear with lightening speed at his face while he staggers back . His hand goes into his coat and he pulls an automatic . As Aissa claws for his throat , he shoots her at zero range . There is a deafening concussion . Her eyes widen , revealing the green fire of her rage as she convulses with the impact . CUT TO : EXT . THE COURTYARD – NIGHT The remainder of the Beast People , standing before the blazing pyre , turn as a burst of gunfire shatters the night . The Hyena-Swine stands in the doorway of the big house , brandishing his Kalashnikov . As the congregation watches he fires a second burst at the stars . HYENA-SWINE Bow to me ! I send the fire that kills . He squeezes off another burst for effect and several of the Beast People drop to their knees . Kiril moves forward pulling the groveling figures back to their feet by the scruffs of their necks . HYENA-SWINE Bow to me ! KIRIL Who are you that I should bow to you ? We are brothers . He turns to face the congregation . KIRIL Children of the Law , we must stand firm . We must uphold the Law and work together now . We must rule with love , not hate . We are brothers , all of us . The Hyena-Swine switches the Kalashnikov onto single fire and shoots Kiril in the back . He pitches forward . The congregation GASPS . The Hyena-Swine CHUCKLES , slides in a new banana clip . Some of the Beast People start to shout now , falling to their knees and wringing their hands . SAYER OF THE LAW No ! This is wrong ! You are breaking the Law ! HYENA-SWINE If It Feels Good , Do It , is the Law ! Montgomery told me so . SAYER OF THE LAW We must have Laws ! We are not animals ! HYENA-SWINE Law no more ! SAYER OF THE LAW ( with incredible feeling ) Are we not men ? The Hyena-Swine laughs , switches his Kalashnikov onto full auto and empties its magazine into the crowd , the Boar Man at his side excitedly joining in the massacre with his own AK-47 . All those who are still standing are caught in a withering rain of bullets , their bodies jerking in the glow of the funeral pyre . The Sayer of the Law is among the first to fall , his mask shattered by a bullet between the eyes . A spray of bullets punch into fuel cans stockpiled in the yard , a rivulet of gasoline creeps away , leading back towards the big house . The Hyena-Swine is laughing and laughing , the gun growing hot in his hands , fire leaping in his eyes . CUT TO : INT . THE LAB - NIGHT Prendick takes a crowbar to a metal file and rips it open . He tears through the papers and finds several note books . He begins frantically flipping through them . CUT TO : EXT . THE BEACH - NIGHT Things have started to slip at the beach party . Several of the Beast Folk lie shaking on the sand , gripped by epileptic seizures , while one of the Cat People has torn out its own eyes and sits screaming beside the projector . The flatbed is stuck in the sand , smoke pouring out of it , M'Ling limping back towards the fire in open embarrassment . Montgomery stands naked in the midst of the admiring Chimaeras , staring back towards the big house , his attention drawn by the sound of GUNFIRE . MONTGOMERY What the fuck now ... ? M'LING Master ! M'Ling steps towards Montgomery but the Bison Man cuts him off , striking the Dog Man over the head with an empty bottle . MONTGOMERY No ! Do n't hurt him ! He makes as if to go to M'Ling 's assistance , but the Bison Man blocks his way . BISON MAN No more Masters ! Montgomery turns to see the other Beast Folk crowding in on him , an awful hunger flaring in their eyes . A low growl ripples across the beach , rising into a snarl of rage . MONTGOMERY Hey I come on , man , lighten up ... This is supposed to be a party ! The little pink Sloth thing steps suddenly forward and shoots Montgomery in the chest with his own automatic . He staggers backwards , staring in disbelief at the puckered hole in his breastbone . MONTGOMERY Shit ! You ... You were always such a sweet little fucker , too ... Jesus ... Thanks a lot ... He falls against the CD-ROM projector and the image goes into gross distortion . He slips to his knees and , with a SHRIEK , the Beast People fall upon him , ripping and ravaging . CUT TO : INT . THE LABORATORY - NIGHT Prendick is edging towards the door Moreau 's black book clutched to his chest , his automatic in his hand when the Hyena-Swine and the Boar Man burst into the room , levelling their rifles . He dives for the cover of the overturned operating table , a bullet meant for his heart hitting instead in the leather cover of Moreau 's journal . He hugs the ground , covering his head as the renegades pump round after round into the laboratory , shattering the overhead lights and laboratory equipment . The big tank cracks and comes apart , spilling a wave of warm amniotic fluid across the floor , the gilled mutations flopping and writhing amidst the broken glass . The Hyena-Swine pauses to reload , padding on the tips of its toes towards Prendick 's hiding place , its teeth bared . HYENA-SWINE Come out and face me ! Let us see who is the Master , now ! Prendick crawls gasping for the safety of the ruined bank of audiovisual equipment , prompting a hysterical burst of GUNFIRE from the Hyena-Swine . Prendick cringes , bullets RICOCHETING and sparking all around him . There follows another lull as the Hyena-Swine fumbles for a fresh clip . Prendick uses the breathing space to reach for the Nagra . The Boar Man turns , levelling his rifle , but at that moment Moreau's icy voice fills the room . MOREAU 'S VOICE Diastolic pressure up to 4 . Pulmonary pressure stands at 5.8 . Heartbeat irregular . The Boar Man freezes , turning to the Hyena-Swine . HYENA-SWINE No ! It is a trick ! He is dead ! We killed him ! He opens fire once more but Prendick has already ducked safely out of sight , crouching behind a console and pulling on a pair of goggles . The Hyena-Swine glances about himself uneasily , then as he steps forward , Prendick reaches out and throws the switch on the laser , its light filling the room with a brilliant blue-green glare . The renegades yell , trying to cover their eyes as Prendick springs from behind the console , shooting the Boar Man in the throat . The Boar Man topples backwards . The Hyena-Swine screams , blindly loosing a burst of gunfire in Prendick 's direction . One of the bullets damages the laser's housing and Prendick decides to take a chance , diving across the room towards the door and tilting the laser from its bearings as he passes . The laser cuts the Hyena-Swine across the face and he tumbles backwards with a shriek , clutching at his face . Then Prendick shoots him in the stomach and he goes down , falling amidst the tendrils of the tank dwellers , still kicking and screaming , one paw grasping for a hand grenade . Prendick takes a step back as the Hyena-Swine pulls the pin and draws back his arm to pitch the grenade , but then one of the tentacles coils around his wrist and holds it tight . Prendick leaps for the door . The Hyena-Swine 's last shriek of pain and fear is cut short by an ear-splitting CONCUSSION and the laboratory is torn apart in a ball of fire and flying shrapnel . CUT TO : EXT . THE COURTYARD – NIGHT Prendick steps over the mound of corpses , eyes narrowed against the smoke , the gun in one hand , Moreau 's black book in the other . PRENDICK Aissa ! He scans the faces of the dead but does not see her among them . The flames are spreading now from the blazing laboratory to the other huts , climbing towards the radio mast . Up ahead , the big house is already on fire and Prendick battles his way towards its door . CUT TO : INT . THE HALL – NIGHT Prendick stumbles coughing through the doorway , one arm raised to protect his face from its burning frame . PRENDICK Aissa ! Then his eyes to adjust to the smoke-filled room and what he sees seems to rob him of what little sanity he has left . Aissa 's body lies on the dining table , her entire torso an open wound , Azazello and the Dog Men sitting around her , as if about to feed on her flesh . Prendick reacts with a bellow of primal rage . He raises his gun and blasts at the Dog Men . One is struck in the head . Another is shot when he runs for the door . Wounded , he runs yelping to a corner where other shots bring him down . Prendick turns the gun on Azazello who glares at him with canine menace . He pulls the trigger but the chamber CLICKS on empty . Azazello turns with a SHRIEK and throws himself through the rear window , fleeing YELPING into the night . Prendick stands over Aissa , beyond grief , beyond any emotion . Taking the compass from her fingers , he holds her hand , as the flames move across the walls around him . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND – NIGHT A series of EXPLOSIONS rip through the enclosure , engulfing the big house , the singing aloes rising screaming in tongues of living flame . CUT TO : EXT . THE BEACH – DAWN Prendick stands watching the rising sun . He seems transformed by grief and by his exposure to horror . The big house is burning behind him . Montgomery 's remains are at his feet covered in a blood-soaked blanket . M'Ling kneels beside him , weeping . M'LING They are mad ! They are fools ! They say there is no Law . No Master . No whips . No House of Pain anymore . We love the Law and will keep it now but there is no more pain , no more whips forever again , they say . But I know , Master , I know . You still live . You have walked in the sea and lived . Prendick pats M'Ling 's head . PRENDICK You 're a good man , M'Ling . M'LING You will kill them all ? Prendick turns his eyes towards the burning flatbed and the remnants of the motor launch . There are bodies strewn all over the beach . PRENDICK No . Not all . M'LING The Master 's will is sweet . Behind them the radio mast collapses , sending a flurry of sparks climbing into the heavens . CUT TO : EXT . THE COMPOUND – DAY The SOUND of the HORN rises once more into the morning air . Prendick , M'Ling , Assassimon and two of the remaining elders stand on the rostrum , Azazello bound and kneeling at their feet . The rest of the islanders gather uneasily before them . There are fewer than thirty of them left . PRENDICK He ’ s not dead ! He 's speaking to me right now ! The House of Pain will be back again ! You can't see the Master , but he 's watching everything you do ! M'LING True ! True ! The Fox Lady steps forward , cradling one of the children from the incubators . FOX LADY The Man Who Walks in the Sea now leads . PRENDICK The Master speaks through me . For those who break the Law ! ASSASSIMON Back to the House of Pain ! Back to the House of Pain ! The congregation takes up the chant , their voices swelling . Prendick stares in cold fury as Azazello slinks forward contrite and very frightened . He kneels before Prendick , who touches his head with barely-controlled hatred . ALL ( CHORUS ) Back to the House of Pain ! Back to the House of Pain ! AZAZELLO ( looking imploringly at Prendick ) Back to the House of Pain ! Back to the House of Pain ! He tries to lick Prendick 's hand . Prendick puts the gun to Azazello 's head and the Dog Man whimpers . The gun jumps , spitting fire , and Azazello falls , blood jetting from his temple . The audience falls silent . FOX LADY The gun has spoken ! It is good ! They fall into a new rhythm , their chant rising and rising . ALL ( CHORUS ) His is the hand that wounds ! His is the hand that heals ! His is the lightning flash ! His is the deep salt sea ! Prendick stands looking out over them , Moreau 's book still clutched under his arm , the gun clenched in his free hand . It 's as though he 's staring at something a thousand miles away , as tears start down his cheeks . The crowd bows down , the sky filled with black smoke rising from the ruins behind them , the emblem of the Tree of Life still fluttering from the flagpole above . DISSOLVE TO : INT . THE CAVE - DAY Prendick stands in the shaft of light at the center of the cavern , the fetish staff in his hands , leading the chanting congregation . His hair and beard have grown long and wild now , his and his clothes are embroidered with bones and tassels , face bedaubed with paint . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) After that day I became the Sayer of the Law . Every day for nine months I stood in front of the Tree of Life and talked to them . DISSOLVE TO : INT . THE CAVE – NIGHT Prendick is observing the moon through a cleft in the rock and marking the lunar calendar painted on the cavern wall . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) I rewrote the Law and tried to teach them new ways to survive on their own . The Law I gave them was the Law I dreamed of as a boy , that had made me want to be a lawyer , a Law that never really existed anywhere in the real world , except here . DISSOLVE TO : EXT . THE ISLAND – DAY Prendick stands thigh deep in the river teaching M'Ling and the others the finer points of spear fishing , a lesson interrupted when two of the onlookers start to squabble over a particularly juicylooking barbel . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) I taught them all I could , but day by day the animal returned to take over that which was human . Like it always has and always will . Like Moreau said it would . DISSOLVE TO : EXT . THE SETTLEMENT – DAY Prendick , M'Ling and several others huddle beneath a fan of woven palm leaves , sheltering from a torrential downpour . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) About thirty of them had survived and eight of those were dead by the end of the hurricane season , most from untreatable illnesses caused by their genetic disorders . I knew that if Aissa had lived she would have shared their fate , but that did n't take the pain away . By the time the trade winds blew again from the west , only M'Ling and Assassimon still clung to the power of speech , and were able to help me in my work . DISSOLVE TO : EXT . THE BEACH – DAY Moreau 's horse has been employed in dragging logs down from the rainforest to where M'Ling and Prendick are shaping them with makeshift axes . Assassimon sits nearby , emptying barrels of diesel into the sand . There follows a MONTAGE of activity as the raft slowly takes shape , Assassimon rigging its sails as it lies at berth next to the jetty , while Prendick and M'Ling load it with supplies . PRENDICK I 'll be back with help . Give me three months . M'LING It is good . Go well , Master . PRENDICK Go well yourself , M'Ling . Good M'Ling . He embraces M'Ling . The Dog Man fawns upon him , whimpering . Then he pulls away and , clambering aboard the raft , makes ready and casts off . Assassimon comes running down the jetty , shouting at the top of his lungs . ASSASSIMON He is going ! He is good ! He is going ! He is great ! Prendick strikes an offshore current , unfurling a bright sheet of homespun from the mast , a gaudy representation of The Tree Of Life painted in its center . The wind fills the sail and he adjusts the tillers , turning the raft 's prow towards the open sea . M'Ling sits down , his big feet dangling over the edge of the jetty , looking a little dejected , watching until Prendick is far away . M'LING We must read . We must keep speech for his return . Then he lifts a battered copy of Alice in Wonderland and begins to read aloud once more while Assassimon , hopping from foot to foot , pretends to mouth the words over his shoulder . M'LING ( reads , haltingly ) '' Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall : Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . All the King 's horses and all the King 's men . Could n't put Humpty Dumpty together again . '' M'Ling 's voice falters , tapering off into a bestial whimper . He sits for a long while in silence , the book sagging in his hands , watching the sail of Prendick 's raft until it has disappeared from sight . DISSOLVE TO : THE DISC OF THE SUN A dazzling , overexposed white . DISSOLVE THROUGH WHITE TO : EXT . THE PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY ( TWO DAYS LATER ) Prendick lies on his back on the raft , the sail flapping slackly now ; his face raw and blistered from the sun . His head sways with the rise and fall of the ocean and all the horizon seems to sway with him , the earth and sky and the shining crack that separates them . A dark smudge appears on the horizon . Dancing . Drawing nearer . He closes his eyes . When he opens his eyes again he sees the side of a freighter looming over him , a row of figures gathered at the rail , outlines silhouetted against the sun . Hands lift him now . Twisted , misshapen hands tipped with curious nails . His eyes focus on his rescuers and he sees the intent faces of beasts of prey glaring down at him , their faces snoutish and porcine , back covered with a sickly pink skin , their lips curling from yellowed teeth . He looks at them , completely blank . CUT TO : INT . THE SANATORIUM - DAY ( THREE YEARS LATER ) Prendick blinks , opening his eyes to find that he is on his chair in Dr. Murnau 's office , the beasts have CHIEF DOCTOR and two of the staff psychiatrists , DR. MOCH , sitting facing him . He is clean shaven now and brand new suit and tie . still sitting become the WIENE and DR. is wearing a MURNAU I 'm glad we 're in agreement . You finally understand you 've been suffering an acute form of post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by the plane crash and your terrible ordeal at sea ... You should be able to gradually unlock the memory of what really happened to you during that lost year . PRENDICK I have . I see that nothing much happened at all . I was simply adrift . DR. MOCH Perhaps as a young man you read about the real Doctor Moreau , who won Nobel Prize in 1989 . The controversy surrounding his work could have been incorporated into your fantasies . Prendick smiles , nods . PRENDICK So I guess now it 's on with my life . MURNAU You 've come a very long way . PRENDICK Thank you , Gentlemen . Thank you all , for everything . He stands , folding his coat over his arm . When he looks back at the doctors , however , it is to find them transformed into scabrous carrion birds staring hungrily at him across the desktop with their vulpine , bespectacled eyes , their dark wings stirring threateningly . He maintains his smile . CUT TO : EXT . THE STREET - DAY Prendick stands on the corner of a busy city street , his coat still folded over his arm , staring at the hubbub of life that surrounds him . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) I was released from the hospital in October 2010 . The world had n't come to an end , although there had been a nuclear exchange . Everything else , it seems , had been a symptom of my psychosis . We see the crowded street now through Prendick 's eyes . Weary DEER MEN and CATTLE PEOPLE shambling past him with wounded eyes , dripping blood , OLD PEOPLE , bent and dull murmuring to themselves , prowling WOMEN mewing after him and dancing packs of jibing MONKEY CHILDREN skipping through a gridlocked traffic jam of barking CANINE MOTORISTS , belligerent PORCINE TRAFFIC POLICE trying to maintain order . Prendick turns now , seeing his own reflection in a shop window , the reflection of a rather melancholy-looking sheepdog lost that has its flock , its eyes tired and lonely . CUT TO : INT . THE COTTAGE - DUSK The fire is low on the hearth . Prendick sits hunched in the semidarkness , the loaded gun still cradled in his hands , finishing up his final message running through the Nagra , a dog barking in the distance . Moreau 's notebook lies open on the table before him , a reproduction of Draper 's `` Lament for Icarus '' tacked on the wall behind him . All over the desk , on crumpled pieces of paper , are sketches of the Tree of Life . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) On the island , I had thought that Moreau was the loneliest man on the earth . But that was before I became what I 've become ... I 've spent my time in reading , and studying biochemistry only to realize that what Moreau did was in fact possible . What happened ca n't be dismissed as a nightmare . So I 've had no choice but to live alone with the horrible truth . Prendick raises the gun , closing his eyes . PRENDICK ( V.O . ) ( haltingly ) Now I find there is simply no way to bear the loneliness . In the near background we hear the barking of a dog . Prendick squeezes his eyelids shut , trying to blot out the noise . He draws the hammer back with an audible click . Suddenly , there is the sound of a pair of paws hitting the pane of glass in a French door . The barking is now very loud , almost in the room . Prendick opens his eyes once more . The barking goes on . It has a strange , pleading quality . Prendick lowers the gun and looks toward the door . The dog is looking in . It sees him and barks with sudden recognition . Prendick ca n't avoid the animal . He rises and the dog paws wildly at the doorpanel with obvious joy at his approach . Prendick tries to muster a stern look . PRENDICK I locked you out for a reason . I ca n't very well kill myself with you pestering me . The dog barks imploring , then looks at Prendick and cocks his head . He whympers for Prendick 's affection . PRENDICK What ? You 'd miss me ? The dog responds with a short , decisive bark . Prendick steps to the door and opens it . The dog rushes away with wild joyous excitement . It begins a wild frolic on the hillside before the cottage . The downright silliness of the animal 's joyful exuberant forces a trace of reluctant smile to Prendick 's lips . CUT TO : EXT . SOMEWHERE IN NEW ENGLAND - DUSK A curtain of rain falls across the downland , turned to motes of gold by the dying light , descending as a blessing upon the soft green hills and patchwork farmsteads . The dog comes running along the crest of a hill , rejoicing , barking at the rain , eyes brimming with a simple animal happiness . It skids to a halt , shaking itself , turning its snout towards the dying light . The rain has stopped , the sky is clearing . Its master walks now to stand beside it , his hands in his pockets , contemplating the same awesome view . Then Prendick bends down to pat the dog as it leaps up , putting its paws against his chest , to lick his face that is wet with rain or tears . Prendick looks deep into the sweet liquid eyes of the dog . FADE TO BLACK . ROLL END TITLES . THE END"
